## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. The Plaintiff averred that the Defendant borrowed $700,000 from him pursuant to an agreement dated 7 Oc t 1998 and that despite demands made by him for repayment, the Defendant failed and refused to repay the said loan. 

2\. The writ of summons was served on the Defendant by way of substituted servic e towards the end of Dec 2000. On 10 Jan 2001, judgment in default of appearanc e was entered against the Defendant for the amount of $700,000, interest and c osts. 

3\. On 26 Apr 2001, the Defendant applied to set aside the default judgment and for leave to enter an appearanc e and to defend the ac tion. The Defendant, an Indonesian c itizen, stated in her affidavit that she was not in Singapore between 28 Nov 2000 and 15 Jan 2001 and was not residing in the flat (54 Toh Tuc k Road #02-09 Signature Park, Singapore 596745) at whic h substituted servic e of the writ of summons had been effec ted and that the Plaintiff was aware of these fac ts. She also sought to defend the ac tion on the merits. On 25 May 2001, the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court set aside the default judgment on the ground that it had not been regularly obtained. This was without prejudic e to the Plaintiff’s right to proc eed under Order 14 of the Rules of Court. 

4\. The Defenc e and Counterc laim was then filed. On 21 Sep 2001, the Plaintiff filed his Reply and Defenc e to Counterc laim and, at the same time, applied for summary judgment pursuant to Order 14 of the Rules of Court. The Assistant Registrar granted the Defendant unc onditional leave to defend. The Plaintiff appealed. 

**The Plaintiff’s affidavit of 21 Sep 2001** 

5\. The Plaintiff c laimed that the $700,000 in question was the amount paid by him on the Defendant’s behalf to ac quire the said Signature Park property and that the Defendant had ac knowledged the debt in a doc ument dated 7 Oc t 1998 prepared by her solic itor who had also explained its c ontents to her. This doc ument was in the following terms :

6\. The Plaintiff explained that the Defendant was his "c ompanion" (ie mistress) in Indonesia. When the riots began in Indonesia in May 1998 and Indonesians of Chinese desc ent were targeted, he wanted to ensure the Defendant’s safety and therefore brought her to stay in Singapore temporarily. To enable the Defendant to remain in Singapore for a longer period, he asked her to apply for a study visa and to enrol in some educ ational c ourses until the situation c almed down bac k home. He provided her the nec essary funds to do this. 

7\. Initially, the Defendant stayed in a hotel here and the Plaintiff would visit her there. Being a prominent businessman both in Indonesia and in Singapore, meeting her frequently in the hotel was not the best thing to do. He wanted a plac e where they c ould meet more disc reetly and therefore instruc ted the Defendant to look for an apartment to buy. Further, the property market here was in the doldrums and it was a good time to buy for investment purposes. 

8\. Although the Plaintiff had a home in Cluny Park, Singapore, he was frequently in Indonesia. When the Defendant selec ted the Signature Park property, the Plaintiff approved the purc hase and the pric e as it was suitably private and unlikely to draw muc h attention to the 2 of them. 

9\. The Defendant liaised with the estate agent and the sellers and the option to purc hase the property was taken out in her name. The Plaintiff was not happy with this but dec ided, on further reflec tion, that it would be better not to have his name on rec ord. However, to protec t his interest in the property, he wanted a doc ument prepared that would sec ure the rec overy of his money when the property was sold. That was why the Defendant instruc ted her solic itor to prepare the Ac knowledgement of Debt doc ument dated 7 Oc tober 1998. That was signed around 14 Oc tober 1998, the date of c ompletion of the purc hase. It was unc lear why it was bac k-dated although the Plaintiff explained in his sec ond affidavit that it was intended to have legal effec t from the day the Defendant took possession of the property. 

10\. There was no dispute that the funds for the said purc hase were entirely furnished by the Plaintiff and that the Defendant c ould not have afforded to buy the property on her own. However, the property was never intended as a gift by the Plaintiff to the Defendant. 

11\. The Plaintiff c laimed that the Defendant made some handwritten amendments in the Indonesian language to the draft of the Ac knowledgement of Debt whic h he agreed to. He said the amendments pertained to the last paragraph on the forgiveness of debt but c orrec ted this in his subsequent affidavit as the amendments ac tually c onc erned his disc retionary power of sale. 

12\. The Plaintiff exhibited a letter dated 21 May 2001 from his solic itors to the law firm (M/s Ganesha & Partners) whic h dealt with the c onveyanc ing and the Ac knowledgement of Debt. In that letter, his solic itors asked c ertain questions relating to the Ac knowledgement of Debt. M/s Ganesha & Partners’ reply, c ontained in their letter of 22 May 2001, stated that they rec eived instruc tions to draft the 


said doc ument from the Defendant on or about 7 Oc tober 1998. The solic itors also stated that they understood from the Defendant that the handwritten amendments to the draft were proposed by the Plaintiff. The letter also stated that Mr Ganesha explained to the Defendant the nature and the c ontents of the doc ument and told her at the same time that the Plaintiff had informed them that the purpose of the doc ument was to enable the Defendant to explain to the Singapore Government or authorities how she was able to ac quire the said property in c ase inquiries were made. Her solic itors were satisfied that the said doc ument would satisfy the purpose of showing the sourc e of funds. 

**The Defendant’s affidavit of 18 October 2001** 

13\. The Defendant was born in Surabaya, Indonesia, on 13 April 1975. The Plaintiff is about 80 years old. She first met the Plaintiff, one of the ric hest men in Indonesia, in Jakarta in Marc h 1992 when she was about 17 years old. She had gone to Jakarta, after c ompleting High Sc hool, with an aunt to visit her c ousin who was then also a "c ompanion" of the Plaintiff and being maintained by him in a house bought by him for her. The aunt was the mother of the said c ousin. 

14\. Initially, the Plaintiff did not know the Defendant was staying in the c ousin’s house as she would stay out of sight upstairs. In May or June 1992, his body guards informed him of her presenc e. She was then introduc ed to the Plaintiff who invited here to lunc h but she dec lined. One or two weeks later, she returned to Surabaya. 

15\. She passed her High Sc hool examinations and wanted to study ec onomic s at tertiary level but c ould not afford to do so. 

16\. In February 1993, she met the Plaintiff again when he went to Surabaya with the c ousin during Chinese New Year. The Plaintiff told the Defendant that if she needed a job after graduation from university, she c ould approac h him for help. 

17\. In 1994, the Defendant went to work in a fac tory in Taiwan for about half a year. In 1995, she dec ided to study Ec onomic Management in Universitas Putra Bangsa. She worked during the day and attended lec tures in the evening. 

18\. In Dec ember 1996, she gave up her studies and moved to Semarang to live with her brother. She worked as a bank teller from February to June 1997. 

19\. When she bec ame jobless and had no one to turn to for support, she dec ided to c ontac t the Plaintiff. He invited her to Jakarta and she went there with a very c lose friend, Magdalena Kurniawati Limanto, in August 1997. She regarded Magdalena as her sister. They stayed in a hotel arranged by the Plaintiff. The c osts of the trip by air and the hotel c harges were borne by the Plaintiff. 

20\. The Plaintiff visited them and told the Defendant that he had separated from her c ousin. She was to learn from him subsequently that he had wanted to sell the house whic h was in her c ousin’s name but she was unwilling to do so. Subsequently, her c ousin sold the house without the Plaintiff’s knowledge, kept the proc eeds of sale and moved bac k to Surabaya. 

21\. The Plaintiff then informed the Defendant that he had feelings for her sinc e their first meeting in 

1992\. He told her that he would take c are of her and her family if she would "marry" him. He would buy her a house and take c are of all her material needs for the rest of her life. 

22\. On 7 September 1997, they "married" in a hotel in Jakarta. The Defendant stayed in hotels and 


the Plaintiff visited her from time to time. He told her he was looking for a suitable house to buy for her. About 2 months later, the Plaintiff arranged for her to move into a house owned by his c ompany and provided a c ompany c ar for her use. He forbade her from working, saying he wanted her to c onc entrate on looking after him. 

23\. When the riots broke out in Jakarta in May 1998, the Plaintiff was out of Indonesia. He did not return home but c ame to Singapore instead. He arranged for the Defendant to move to Surabaya for a few days and then to Singapore where she stayed in the Apollo Hotel. The Plaintiff stayed with his family in the Cluny Road bungalow. He would visit her and spent time with her in the hotel room from time to time. 

24\. After a c ouple of weeks, the Defendant returned to Jakarta as instruc ted by the Plaintiff who remained in Singapore. 

25\. In June or July 1998, the Plaintiff told her that as the situation in Jakarta was volatile, it was best for her if he bought a property for her in Singapore where she would live in c omfort and safety. He asked her to look for a freehold property in Distric ts 9, 10 or 11. 

26\. The Defendant, her sister and her brother then c ame to Singapore for this purpose. They stayed in the Apollo Hotel and were introduc ed by the duty manager to an estate agent (who is the wife of Mr Ganesh and who introduc ed the Defendant to his law firm). After viewing several properties, they were brought to Signature Park where 2 units were for sale. After negotiations, she agreed to purc hase the unit in issue for $700,000/-. The Plaintiff was informed by telephone. The property was purc hased in the Defendant’s name as requested by the Plaintiff who paid the purc hase pric e. 

27\. At the Plaintiff’s request, the Defendant returned to Jakarta on 10 September 1998 and proc eeded to buy furniture and other ac c essories for the Signature Park property. These were then shipped to Singapore in a c ontainer. She also purc hased other items in Singapore for the property. All these were given to her by the Plaintiff for her use. 

28\. In Oc tober 1998, the Defendant and her "sister", Magdalena, moved into the said property. The Plaintiff would visit and spend time with the Defendant from time to time. He told her that he wanted her to exec ute a doc ument to explain how she c ame to own the property and that suc h a doc ument was nec essary for her protec tion bec ause the Singapore Government might want to investigate how she was able to make the purc hase. Having no knowledge of Singapore law and having absolute trust in the Plaintiff, with whom she was having a very good relationship, she agreed to exec ute suc h a doc ument. 

29\. The c ontents of the doc ument were dic tated by the Plaintiff to Magdalena in the Indonesian language. He then instruc ted Magdalena to bring the draft to Mr Ganesh and to instruc t him to prepare the doc ument in English. When that had been done, the Plaintiff dic tated some amendments thereto to Magdalena who wrote them out in the Indonesian language on the draft. The amended draft was then faxed by the Defendant to the lawyer on 14 Oc tober 1998. 

30\. The Defendant, ac c ompanied by Magdalena, then went to the lawyers’s offic e to sign the doc ument. Mr Ganesh explained the c ontents to her but also said at the same time that the Plaintiff had informed him that the purpose for the preparation of the doc ument was to enable the Defendant to explain to the Singapore Government or authorities how she was able to ac quire the property in c ase inquiries were made. Sinc e this was the same reason mentioned by the Plaintiff, the Defendant signed the doc ument. The doc ument was signed by the Plaintiff in the Signature Park property after it was interpreted to him by Magdelena. 


31\. The Defendant resumed her studies while in Singapore. She took an English c ourse at Inlingua for about 3 months and also studied English at the British Counc il for about 1 month. Magdalena also took up c ourses here. All the expenses of the Defendant were paid for by the Plaintiff who also bought her a new BMW 520i. 

32\. Around Marc h 1999, the Plaintiff told the Defendant he wished to ac quire some more properties in Singapore. He wanted to buy another property for her so that she c ould live in one and earn rental inc ome from the other and thus would have no financ ial worries for the rest of her life. They were very muc h in love then and the Defendant c ried bec ause she was deeply moved by the Plaintiff’s feelings and c onc ern for her. The Plaintiff then bought for her a property at 28 Sc otts Road #03- ("Sc otts 28") again funding the entire purc hase. 

33\. Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that he would like her to sign the same kind of doc ument for Sc otts 28 that she did for the Signature Park property, repeating the reason for the need to do that. Similarly, ignorant of the law here and trusting the Plaintiff c ompletely, the Defendant was prepared to sign the doc ument requested by the Plaintiff. 

34\. Soon thereafter, the Plaintiff stunned the Defendant one day by c onfessing to her that he had developed feelings for her "sister", Magdelena, and wanted her to be another of his "wives". The Defendant was deeply hurt but said nothing to him. The Plaintiff pestered her to persuade Magdelena to be his "wife". The Defendant told Magdelena about this and she was shoc ked. She dec lined the proposal and told the Plaintiff so. 

35\. Thereafter, the Plaintiff’s attitude and feelings towards the Defendant c hanged. He bec ame very insistent that the Defendant sign the aforesaid doc ument in respec t of Sc otts 28 and the Defendant began to be suspic ious about his true intentions towards her. She therefore kept delaying the exec ution of the doc ument with exc uses. That led to quarrels. The Defendant kept reminding the Plaintiff of his earlier assuranc es to her that both the properties were hers. 

36\. Around May 2000, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that they should move bac k to Jakarta where he had prepared a house owned by one of his c ompanies for her. He therefore wanted her to exec ute a power of attorney for him to sell the 2 properties in Singapore, c laiming that he had lost the doc ument of 7 Oc tober 1998. By this time, she was sure that the Plaintiff was trying to get rid of her and she refused to exec ute any suc h doc ument, leading to frequent quarrels. During the quarrels, he also said he wanted to sell the 2 properties as he was in financ ial diffic ulties. It bec ame obvious to the Defendant that the Plaintiff was angry that Magdalena had rejec ted his advanc es and wanted to vent his anger on the Defendant bec ause she kept refusing to persuade Magdalena to be his "wife". 

37\. In order to esc ape the frequent quarrels, the Defendant and Magdelena left Singapore on 28 November 2000 and had no further c ontac t with the Plaintiff. 

38\. The Defendant maintained that there was never any loan given by the Plaintiff to her as she was c learly in no position to repay any loan of suc h a substantial amount. She maintained that the Signature Park property was a gift to her. The title deeds were in her possession all this time. 

39\. The Defendant c laimed she had been misled about the c ontents and the effec ts of the Ac knowledgement of Debt doc ument of 7 Oc tober 1998 whic h was never intended to be a binding loan doc ument. This was further buttressed by the fac t that the Plaintiff had requested her to exec ute a power of attorney in his favour in November 2000 to enable him to sell the Signature Park property. There would be no need for a power of attorney if the doc ument of 7 Oc tober 1998 was intended to be valid and enforc eable. She also had a c ounterc laim against the Plaintiff for damages 


for c onversion as he had removed all her movable properties in the Signature Park property. 

**Magdalena’s affidavit of 18 October 2001** 

40\. Magdalena stated that she met the Defendant in High Sc hool in 1989 and bec ame so c lose to her that eac h regarded the other as a sister. She went with the Defendant to meet the Plaintiff in August 1997 as she also intended to seek his help in getting a job. On the sec ond day of their stay in Jakarta, the Plaintiff gave her some money and asked her to go shopping as he had something to disc uss in private with the Defendant. When she returned to the hotel, she was told by them that they were getting "married". 

41\. She c onfirmed that the Plaintiff had told the Defendant that he was looking for a house in Jakarta to purc hase for her. When they moved into the house owned by the Plaintiff’s c ompany, the Plaintiff forbade the Defendant to work and told Magdalena not to work as well so that she c ould keep the Defendant c ompany. Both of them had to massage the Plaintiff daily. The Plaintiff gave Magdalena some money monthly for her expenses. 

42\. In Singapore, Magdalena was with the Defendant at all material times save for the moments of intimac y between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in their bedroom. She was therefore able to c onfirm what the Defendant said in her affidavit. 

43\. As for the Plaintiff’s proposal to her, she was shoc ked as she had always regarded him as her brother-in-law. She did not give him an answer immediately as she wanted to figure out a way of telling him without hurting his feelings. The Plaintiff subsequently asked her in front of the Defendant whether she would "marry" him, offering her a c ondominium unit in Gardenville at 10 Walshe Road. She requested the Defendant to leave them alone and then told the Plaintiff that she c ould not "marry" him. He bec ame very angry, telling her that he had never been rejec ted by anyone. He also bec ame angry with the Defendant bec ause he felt the Defendant should have persuaded Magdalena to "marry" him. His attitude towards them c hanged and he started pestering the Defendant to sell the Sc otts 28 property. 

44\. They had no hint at all that the Plaintiff was c ontemplating legal ac tion against the Defendant. Magdalena tried her best to patc h things up between the c ouple but failed as the Plaintiff was adamant about selling both properties and was insistent about the Defendant having to sign c ertain doc uments that he had instruc ted Mr Ganesh to prepare. The Defendant had no knowledge what those doc uments were although the Plaintiff did tell her that one of them was a power of attorney. She knew that the Defendant was not prepared to sign anything. She had no doubt that the 2 properties were gifts by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as they had a very loving relationship at the material time until Magdalena’s rejec tion of his proposal. 

**Plaintiff’s affidavit of 23 November 2001** 

45\. The Plaintiff in response stated that he ac c eded to the Defendant’s request to let Magdalena live with her as they were very c lose to eac h other and the Defendant was afraid to live alone. 

46\. Although he paid for the two properties and the furnishings, he never told the Defendant that they were gifts to her. There was no reason to buy them as gifts as he had already purc hased a house for the Defendant in her hometown of Surabaya in January 1998. In early 2000, he arranged for the property to be c ompletely rebuilt for her as a permanent home and the house was ready in 


Oc tober 2000. 

47\. He had always intended to set up home for the Defendant in Indonesia. She is an Indonesian Citizen. He spent muc h of his time in Indonesia and it would be c onvenient for him to visit her there. Her study visa was temporary. The purc hase of the two properties in Singapore during the downturn was for his investment purposes and, at the same time, would provide the Defendant with ac c ommodation here. It was ludic rous that he would give the Defendant the two properties worth more than S$3million when she was unable to live in Singapore permanently to enjoy them. It would make far better sense if he were to give her c ash instead. 

48\. The Sc otts 28 property is the subjec t of a separate legal ac tion. At the time it was being purc hased in 1999, the Plaintiff had serious health problems and was hospitalized on many oc c asions. The Defendant sought to take advantage of his poor health and advanc ed years and tried to take away the Sc otts 28 property from him. That was the c ause for the unhappiness in the middle of 2000 when he found out and not any alleged spurning by Magdalena in whom he had no romantic interest and who was married to the Defendant’s brother. 

49\. The Defendant had failed to arrange the doc umentation instruc ted by the Plaintiff in respec t of Sc otts 28. Further, when the Plaintiff wanted to sell it, she told him that it was tenanted, she had taken 2 years of rent in advanc e whic h was plac ed in fixed deposit and she wanted to use the interest as additional living expenses espec ially during the periods of his prolonged absenc e. Sc otts 28 was never rented out. She had sold the BMW 520i within a year without telling him. She lied that the c ourses she had enrolled in were for muc h longer periods and took money from him to pay for them. 

50\. The Defendant was now more interested in enric hing herself at the Plaintiff’s expense and that was why she and Magdalena were making the allegations c ontained in their affidavits. 

**The Decision of the Court** 

51\. The Defendant c ontended that Mr Ganesh had said that the "sole purpose" of the Ac knowledgement of Debt doc ument of 7 Oc tober 1998 was to show the sourc e of the Defendant’s funds. Sinc e that was the "sole purpose" for the Defendant to sign the doc ument, it did not matter anymore what other words were in the doc ument although those other words were explained by the lawyer. It was further argued that if the Plaintiff had an unexpressed purpose in mind, then he had dec eived the lawyer. 

52\. The Defendant relied on the dec ision of the Privy Counc il in _Tyagaraja Mudaliar & Another v. Vedathanni_ [1936] MLJ Rep. 62, an appeal from India. There, a doc ument only intended to c reate evidenc e of the undivided status of a Hindu family inc luded an agreement that the widow signing the doc ument relinquish her c laims for maintenanc e. When the widow sought to rec over arrears of maintenanc e, it was held that oral evidenc e in disproof of the alleged agreement, that the doc ument was never intended to operate as a agreement but was brought into existenc e solely for the purpose o f c reating evidenc e of some other matter, stood exac tly on the same footing as evidenc e that a signature was forged. Suc h oral evidenc e c ould therefore be adduc ed. 

53\. The Defendant submitted that it was a question of fac t what exac tly the doc ument of 7 Oc tober 1998 was meant to be. The Plaintiff had not denied the purpose was as indic ated by the lawyer. His solic itors had asked Mr Ganesh whether that was one of the purposes but Mr Ganesh replied otherwise. The Defendant was not told that the other provisions in that doc ument were to make it an enforc eable loan agreement. 


54\. It should be noted that the widow in that c ase had refused to sign the doc ument when it was presented to her 3 days after her husband’s death. She was induc ed to do so 2 days later by representations that it would not be ac ted on and that its only purpose was to provide evidenc e of the undivided status of the family. The Defendant in our c ase was under no pressure of any sort, emotional or otherwise. Indeed, she said that the relationship between her and the Plaintiff then was a very loving one. There was not even any evidenc e that the doc ument had to be signed in a great hurry. 

55\. There was no doubt that Mr Ganesh did tell her what the Plaintiff said the purpose of the doc ument was. The lawyer c ertainly did not tell her that that was the sole or only purpose or that the other c lauses were thrown in as dec oys and were not meant to be ac ted upon. The stated purpose was true in any event and was ac hieved – the doc ument did show that the money c ame from the Plaintiff as a loan and not as a gift and the other provisions reinforc ed that fac t rather than detrac ted from it to any extent. 

56\. What was so sinister about this purc hase anyway? It was not as if the Plaintiff was not entitled under Singapore law to make the purc hase and was using the Defendant as a front to fool the authorities here. Their relationship was very good and the money was his to do as he pleased. What need was there for him to tric k the Defendant in any way? If it was meant to be a gift from lavish "husband" to beloved "wife", why not just say so? 

57\. The evidenc e showed that Mr Ganesh faithfully and ac c urately explained everything to the Defendant who raised no protest or query about the terms, obviously bec ause that was the understanding she had with her "husband", her provider of all material things. The amendments pertaining to the power of sale must have c ome from the Plaintiff rather than the Defendant, c ontrary to the Plaintiff’s assertions, but that did not c hange anything of substanc e here. Indeed, it would be further evidenc e of the Plaintiff wanting to be doubly sure there was no doubt who owned the property, whic h would be the Defendant’s only if the Plaintiff should pass away without having dealt with the property. 

58\. Clearly, the Defendant had no defenc e to the Plaintiff’s c laim and had raised nothing that would merit a trial. I therefore allowed the Plaintiff’s appeal and gave judgment as c laimed. I awarded the Plaintiff $5000/- c osts for the entire ac tion.
