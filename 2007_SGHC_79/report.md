2       The Husband filed two appeals. The first, RAS No 720020/2006, was an appeal against the above orders of 16 Marc h 2006. The sec ond, RAS No 720033/2006, was an appeal against a refusal by another judge, Distric t Judge Jeffrey Sim, to stay those orders. Both appeals were heard by me on 16 Oc tober 2006, at whic h time I made c ertain orders. The Wife’s solic itors applied for further arguments whic h I heard on 8 January 2007, at the end of whic h I modified slightly my orders of 16 Oc tober 2006. In the result the following are the final orders made on 8 January 2007: 

 (a) On the question of ac c ess in Order (b) of the Distric t Judge: 

 (i) paragraph (i) amended to “Alternate weekends from Fridays 6pm to Sunday morning at start of usual c hurc h servic e, at c hurc h”. 

 (ii) paragraph (ii) amended to “Saturdays 2pm to 9pm, but if the c hildren are not in Singapore, then to be made up by ac c ess on Wednesday (before or after) 6pm to 9pm”. 

 (iii) paragraph (iii) amended by adding “apart from Chinese New Year and Good Friday”. 

 (iv) in paragraph (v) “Petitioner is to have the c hildren on Chinese New Year and Respondent to have c hildren on Good Friday holidays, from Thursday 6pm to Sunday c hurc h servic e hour. If that weekend does not c oinc ide with Respondent’s ac c ess weekend, this will be swapped for either previous or subsequent weekend”. 

 (v) paragraph (vi) amended to inc lude “with liberty to take c hildren abroad”. 

 (vi) paragraph (vii) amended to “Daily phone ac c ess”. 

 (b) On Orders (c ), (f ), (g), (h), (i) of the Distric t Judge, the matter is remitted to the c ourt below for trial of the issue of the Respondent’s assets. 

 (c ) In the interim, the Respondent is to pay $3,500 for c hildren and $1 for Petitioner per month. 


 (d) Any orders for payment of arrears of maintenanc e and loan are stayed pending determination in Order (2). 

 (e) Costs of this appeal to be paid by Respondent to Petitioner fixed at $4,000, inc lusive of stay applic ation before DJ Jeffrey Sim. 

3       The Wife has appealed against Orders (b), (c ) and (d) above and I now give the grounds for my dec ision. 

4       The parties were married on 18 September 1992. They have a daughter and a son, aged 10 and 6 years. On 16 August 2002, the Wife filed a petition for divorc e on the grounds of his unreasonable behaviour. The Dec ree Nisi was made on 17 Oc tober 2003 and it was made absolute on 28 June 2004. There have been a number of hearings on the anc illaries leading to the orders made by the Distric t Judge on 16 Marc h 2006. The Petitioner’s appeal to the Court of Appeal essentially pertains to my order to remit the matter to the Distric t Court for trial on the issue of the Respondent’s assets. 

5       Although the judge below c onsidered the Husband’s assertions that he did not have muc h assets nor did he have muc h inc ome, she did not c onsider it nec essary to order c ross-examination of these issues. Instead she c onc luded that he had the c apac ity to earn enough to pay the arrears and future maintenanc e from the fac t that he had signed c ertain doc uments. However the Husband had also produc ed evidenc e that he owed about $13,000 to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). As for assets, the judge below drew an adverse inferenc e from the lac k of forthrightness of the Husband and held that he had assets worth $1.2m. 

6       Sec tion 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, Rev Ed 1997) gives the c ourt power to order division of matrimonial assets in the c ourse of divorc e proc eedings. In exerc ising this power, the c ourt must first determine what those matrimonial assets are and their value. This is usually done by way of affidavits and where there is agreement as to their c onstituents and value, the c ourt c an proc eed to c onsider the division having regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase pursuant to s 112(2). Even where the parties are not in full agreement as to these matters, the c ourt may proc eed on the basis of the affidavits if it c onsiders that the areas of disagreement are not substantial or the c ourt is in a position to resolve them from the c ontents of the affidavits. 

7       However it is a very different matter if there are substantial areas of disagreement, in whic h c ase any division ordered by the c ourt runs the risk of c ausing injustic e to one or the other party, or worse, rendering the order unenforc eable thereby benefiting neither party. If the c ourt undervalues the assets of one party, injustic e is done to the other party in that the latter rec eives less than what he or she would otherwise be awarded. On the other hand if the c ourt overvalues the assets of one party, injustic e is done to that party. 

8       Worse still if the c ourt severely overvalues the assets of a party bec ause that party c ould have no means to pay the sum ordered in the division. In the present c ase, that is exac tly the c omplaint of the Husband, who c laimed that he did not have the assets and the inc ome that the Wife c laimed he had. He had stated in his affidavits that he had very little assets and attributed this to business failure. He had also deposed that he had very little inc ome as he only worked in odd jobs and depended on his parents to lend him money for the interim maintenanc e ordered. In my view, where there is a c onflic t of evidenc e in relation to c ruc ial issues suc h as the amount of assets owned by one party or his inc ome, the c ourt ought to have resolved the matter by way of a trial. This is to ensure that any subsequent order for transfer of assets or maintenanc e would be based on assets or inc ome that ac tually exist. 


9       I ac c ordingly made the Orders (b) and (d) but ordered interim maintenanc e in Order (c ).
