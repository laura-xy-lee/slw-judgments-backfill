## Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Culpable homicide not amounting to murder 

## – Mentally-impaired accused – Primary concerns for mentally impaired accused in such offence 

## – When life imprisonment appropriate – Appropriate sentence – s 304(a) Penal Code (Cap 224) 

## impaired his better judgment and control. Dr Phang added that however impaired though the 

## accused’s judgment might have been at and around the material time, he still retained sufficient 

## mental capacity to be capable of forming an intent to cause the injuries in question. Dr Phang noted 

## that the accused had a history of epilepsy dating back to 1983 and his seizures were not optimally 

## controlled in spite of treatment, with recurrences on a regular basis. The accused would have a 

## predilection towards behaving violently and dangerously when in an epileptic seizure. Dr Phang 

## concluded that the accused would require treatment and close follow-up on a permanent basis. 

## The accused pleaded guilty and was convicted for the offence of committing culpable homicide 

## not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, Cap 224. The sole issue before the court 

## was what was the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case where the accused was found to 

## be suffering from a mental condition which required treatment on a permanent basis. 

## Held, 

## imposing a sentence of life imprisonment : 

## (1) In relation to the sentence to be imposed, attention was drawn to the sentences imposed by 

## the High Court in eight recent cases. It would appear from the cases that the courts have imposed 

## sentences of life imprisonment in similar situations where mentally impaired offenders were convicted 

## for committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The concern addressed by the courts in 

## those cases were more in the direction of treatment, rehabilitation and prevention rather than 

## deterrence or retribution. 

## (2) The accused was apparently oblivious to the fact that the person whom he attacked – that 

## too over a trivial pearl bracelet – was none other than his mother, as he was then in the throes of an 

## epileptic seizure. The accused was indeed in need of a long and closely monitored treatment regimen, 

## and if not afforded that, the likelihood of danger and harm to the public was not imaginary but real. 

## (3) Consequently, having regard to all the factors, the accused is sentenced to a term of 

## imprisonment for life with a direction that the accused be given treatment on a regular basis for his 

## illness whilst serving his sentence.

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. Lim Hock Hin, a 42-year old male Singaporean pleaded guilty before me and w as convicted for an 

offence of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304 (a) of the Penal Code (Cap 

224). The charge he faced averred that he slashed his 65-year old mother w ith a knife at about 11.30 am, 

on 13 November 2001 w ith the intention of causing bodily hurt as w as likely to cause death and caused her 

to suffer death on 20 November 2001. 

2\. The facts w hich gave rise to the present proceedings can be summarised as follow s. 

3\. The accused and his mother Mdm Tan Ah Pong w ere residing at a flat at Block 12 Redhill Close, #01- 

106, Singapore. At about 11.30 am, on 13 November 2001, the accused had an argument w ith his mother 


in their flat over the w hereabouts of a pearl bracelet given to him by someone. In the course of the 

altercation, he started pushing his mother in the chest continuously. When his mother w as trying to placate 

him by saying that she could not recall w here she had placed the bracelet, the accused started to become 

violent. He first used a chair and later other objects w hich he could get hold of from the kitchen to hit and 

hurt her. When his mother continued to protest that she could not recall w here the bracelet w as, the 

accused suddenly seized a knife found nearby and slashed her, causing her to fall. 

4\. It w ould appear that after Mdm Tan w as hurt, she somehow managed to find her w ay to her 

neighbour’s flat and informed her neighbour that her son had stabbed her w ith a knife. The neighbour then 

called the police. 

5\. The accused, in the meantime, fled the flat in panic. How ever, as he reached the top floor of a 

nearby block of flats, he felt that his mother might still be alive. He then decided to return home and he did. 

6\. Upon his return, the accused noticed the presence of police officers as w ell as his siblings outside 

the flat. Presently, he asked the police the condition of his mother and w as told that she w as all right. He 

w as soon arrested and sent to hospital for treatment as he w as found to have injured his right hand. 

7\. The post-mortem finding of Dr Wee Kheng Poh, Consultant Forensic Pathologist from the Centre for 

Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, w as that the cause of the death of the victim w as 

bronchopneumonia w ith hypoxic encephalopathy follow ing a slash w ound of the neck. The post-mortem 

report also listed a number of injuries to the victim’s head, neck, chest, abdomen and arms. 

8\. The accused w as, in the event, sent to Woodbridge Hospital for a psychiatric assessment. In the 

opinion of Dr Stephen Phang, Consultant Psychiatrist from Woodbridge Hospital and the Institute of Mental 

Health, the accused w as suffering from an acute epileptic seizure at the time of the offence w hich 

significantly impaired his better judgment and impulse control, to the extent that he attacked his mother 

fatally as a direct consequence of his malady, w hich he w ould not have done had he not had a fit that 

morning. Dr Phang added that ‘how ever impaired though his judgement may have been at and around the 

material time, he still retained sufficient mental capacity to be capable of forming an intent to cause the 

injuries in question’. 

9\. Further, according to Dr Phang, the accused retained the mental capacity to know that his act w as 

likely to cause death, although unfortunately, his mental responsibility w as significantly diminished at and 

around the material time, qualifying him for the defence of diminished responsibility. Dr Phang noted that 

the accused had a history of epilepsy dating back to 1983 and his seizures w ere still not optimally 

controlled in spite of treatment, w ith recurrences on a regular basis. He commented further that w hen in 

the throes of an epileptic seizure, the accused w ould have a predilection tow ards behaving violently and 

dangerously. He concluded that the accused required treatment and close follow -up on a permanent basis. 

10\. The sole question before the court w as w hat w as the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this 

case w here the accused w as found to be suffering from a mental condition w hich required treatment on a 

permanent basis. 

11\. Section 304(a) of the Penal Code provides that: 

 Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished w ith imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term w hich may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning, if the act by w hich death is caused is done w ith the intention of causing death, or of 


 causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. 

12\. Defence counsel in his mitigation plea urged the court not to impose a sentence of life 

imprisonment on the accused. In this regard, he invited my attention to the view expressed by defence 

psychiatrist, Dr Y C Lee w ho said that he ‘ _believed that if the epilepsy of the accused is well controlled and his_ 

_psychosis is kept in remission with medications, he[ would be] able to live a normal life and would not be a_ 

_danger to others_ .’ It w as all w ell said but the question remained as to w ho w as going to ensure the control 

and treatment regimen suggested by Dr Lee. The sad fact w as that his mother w ho w as residing w ith him 

w as gone forever because of his sudden violence. 

13\. The learned DPP in his submission said that the belief expressed by the defence psychiatrist 

appeared to be predicated by a number of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ and urged the court to take public interest into 

consideration. He reiterated Dr Phang’s prognosis that the accused required treatment and close follow -up 

on a permanent basis due to his continuing predilection tow ards violent and dangerous behaviour and the 

attendant danger to the public and those w ho w ould be in immediate contact w ith him. 

14\. In relation to the sentence to be imposed, my attention w as invited to the sentences imposed by 

the High Court in the recent few years. Eight cases w ere cited and they w ere: **_Public Prosecutor v Ong_** 

**_Wee Teck_** (2001) 3 SLR 479, **_Public Prosecutor v Kwok Teng Soon_** (2001) 4 SLR 576, **_Public Prosecutor_**

1       6. It w ould appear from the abovementioned cases that the courts have imposed sentences of life 

imprisonment in similar situations w here mentally impaired offenders w ere convicted for committing culpable 

homicide not amounting to murder. To my mind, the concern addressed by the courts in the cases referred 

to w ere more in in the direction of treatment, rehabilitation and prevention rather than deterrence or 

retribution. I w as inclined to share the same view. 

1       7. The accused in the case before me w as apparently oblivious to the fact that the person w hom he 

attacked – that too over a trivial pearl bracelet – w as none other than his mother, as he w as then in the 

throes of an epileptic seizure. I w as in agreement w ith the expert opinion that the accused w as indeed in 

need of a long and closely monitored treatment regimen, and if not afforded that, the likelihood of danger 

and harm to the public w ere not imaginary but real. In any event, in my view , the conditions for a long 

sentence set out in **_R v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson_** (1968) 52 Cr App R 113 (per MacKenna J) and 

approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in **_Neo Man Lee v Public Prosecutor_** [1991] 2 ML J 369 at 370, by 

and large seemed to apply to the facts and circumstances of the case at hand. The conditions mentioned in 

**_Hodgson_** w ere: 

 A sentence of life imprisonment is justified w hen (1) the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant’s history that he is unstable and likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence. 

1       8. Consequently, having considered all the factors, I sentenced the accused to a term of 

imprisonment for life w ith a direction that the accused be given treatment on a regular basis for his illness 

w hilst serving his sentence. In imposing the sentence, I w as also mindful of the aspect that under Rule 

119A of the Prisons Regulations, the accused might w ell receive a remission of sentence if the Life 

Imprisonment Review Board w ere to conclude at the appropriate stage that he w ould be suitable for such 

remission. 

_Order accordingly._
