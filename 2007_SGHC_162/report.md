**Choo Han Teck J:** 

1       This was an applic ation by the plaintiff, for leave to c ommenc e legal proc eedings against the defendant pursuant to s 299(2) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The plaintiff is the Management Corporation of a c ondominium known as Carissa Park. The defendant was the main c ontrac tor in the c onstruc tion of the c ondominium. The defendant was plac ed under a c reditors’ voluntary winding up on 10 Dec ember 2004. 

2       The plaintiff c laimed that there were various defec ts in the c ondominium whic h were c aused by poor workmanship and for whic h it was entitled to sue the c ontrac tor defendant for damages in tort. The defec ts were first notic ed in 2002, but Mr Tan Yeow Hiang (“Mr Tan”), c ounsel for the plaintiff, submitted that “the limitation period in respec t of c ertain of the defec ts will expire on 30 September 2007”. 

3       This applic ation was filed on 5 September 2007 and heard on 11 September 2007. Having c onsidered the affidavits filed on behalf of the plaintiff on 5 September 2007 and 17 September 2007, and the submissions of Mr Tan and Miss Tan Mingfen (“Miss Tan”), for the defendant (in liquidation), I dismissed the plaintiff’s applic ation for leave on 20 September 2007. 

4       The plaintiff’s c laim was estimated at $1.5m. There were no partic ulars as to how muc h would be owing to the other general c reditors who had filed their proofs of debt. If the plaintiff was given leave to proc eed, the defendant may not have the means to defend the ac tion and a judgment in default for $1.5m is far too unfair, in my view, to the other c reditors. 

5       If the plaintiff did have a suffic iently strong c laim, the applic ation ought to have been made muc h sooner. The applic ation was made barely three weeks before the time bar for suing. The defendant was wound up in Dec ember 2004. 

6       Furthermore, Mr Tan had not disputed Miss Tan’s submission that many of the sub-c ontrac tors’ indemnities were already assigned to the plaintiff. Many of the defec ts were related to spec ialist sub


c ontrac tors’ work, and if there was any liability in tort, the plaintiff will have rec ourse against the sub-c ontrac tors. 

7       I also formed the view that the lateness in this applic ation was entirely unjustifiable even though Mr Tan submitted that there was effec tively no Management Counc il for a great part of this year (after it had sent a letter of demand on 9 April 2007) until 14 July 2007. The c irc umstanc es seemed to me to indic ate that the plaintiff was ac tuated by a desire to keep too many options open. That is legitimate, but it must then ac c ept the risk that some of the options might be c losed to it – suc h as this applic ation, if it is unable to persuade the c ourt that the merits tilt in its favour for leave to proc eed.
