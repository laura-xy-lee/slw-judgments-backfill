22     Marc h 2016 

**Debbie Ong JC:** 

1       This c ase c onc erned a business venture (“the Business Venture”) between two c lose friends whic h, like the relationship between them, eventually broke down. The Business Venture was built on a relationship of c lose friendship and mutual trust, where matters tended to be c onduc ted in an informal manner. Proper formal rec ords were not kept and investment developments were disc ussed in somewhat c asual ways. 

**Background facts** 

2       The plaintiff was the managing direc tor of a multi-national c ompany in Singapore. It is unc lear as to when the plaintiff c ame to be ac quainted with the defendant; the plaintiff said that he had been introduc ed to the defendant by a mutual friend in 2009 when he was looking to sell his c ar, while the defendant stated that it was in 2006. In any c ase, it was not disputed that they bec ame c lose friends over time. Their c lose friendship is demonstrated by the c ontent of their exc hange of messages over the WhatsApp platform, amongst other c irc umstanc es. The defendant had also assisted the plaintiff on numerous oc c asions, suc h as arranging for c ontrac tors to perform repairs to the plaintiff’s home, mediating in respec t of a dispute that the plaintiff had with his landlord, and helping the plaintiff to find a plac e to stay. 

3       Through their interac tions, the plaintiff c ame to know about the defendant’s investments. The parties explored the idea of c ollaborating on other investments. Between February and April 2012, the parties met up multiple times, during whic h they disc ussed in greater detail the investment opportunities they c ould undertake. These did not appear to be meetings at whic h formal proposals were disc ussed. Instead, they were usually c onduc ted at fast food restaurants, and involved the defendant sharing about his investment experienc es and the parties exc hanging views on investment opportunities. Eventually, in April 2012, they agreed to undertake the Business Venture on the following terms, amongst others: 

 (a) The c apital for the Business Venture would be provided by the plaintiff and the defendant in equal shares. 

 (b) The plaintiff’s share of the c apital c ontributions would be limited to the funds that he c ould 


 raise or obtain from the c redit fac ilities obtained from the banks. 

 (c ) None of the plaintiff’s share of the c apital c ontributions would be utilised or applied for the ac quisition of assets other than for the Business Venture jointly agreed to by the plaintiff and the defendant. 

 (d) Any investment yields from any asset ac quired for the Business Venture would be ac c ountable to the partnership and divided equally between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

4       Pursuant to the Business Venture, the plaintiff obtained c redit fac ilities from a number of banks, through whic h $536,000 was disbursed to his bank ac c ount between April and June 2012 (“the Loans”). At the same time, the plaintiff transferred at least $497,830 of the Loans sums (“the plaintiff’s c ontributions”) from his bank ac c ount to a bank ac c ount held in the joint names of the defendant and his wife, for use as funds for the Business Venture. In turn, the defendant also transferred at least $97,800 to the plaintiff between April and September 2012 whic h the plaintiff used to servic e the Loans. The defendant c ontinued to transfer money to the plaintiff regularly until the parties fell out with eac h other sometime in Marc h 2013. 

5       How the plaintiff’s c ontributions were applied was the major point of dispute between the parties, but it was agreed that at least some of this money was used for investments in properties in Malaysia. This inc luded the ac quisition of two c luster homes in a residential property development loc ated at Taman Mount Austin in Johor Bahru, Johor, whic h were held by the plaintiff and the defendant as joint tenants (“the Austin Residenc es”), as well as a share in a c ommerc ial shop-house loc ated at Kempas Town Centre in Johor Bahru, Johor (“the Kempas Property”). A c ompany, Global KPP Pte Ltd (“Global KPP”), was also inc orporated in Singapore as part of the Business Venture. 

6       Sometime in Marc h 2013, the plaintiff and the defendant had a disagreement over the plaintiff’s plans to purc hase a plot of land in a development in Johor known as the Leisure Farm. The defendant then stopped the transfers to the plaintiff who, through his solic itors, then sought an ac c ount of the assets ac quired with the plaintiff’s c ontributions. This eventually c ulminated in the present suit being filed. 

**The parties’ respective cases** 

7       Initially, the parties appeared to dispute whether they were in a partnership relationship. Subsequently, this was no longer an issue as both parties proc eeded on the basis that they were in a partnership relationship. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had breac hed the duties he owed as a partner to the partnership and/or the terms of the partnership agreement. The ac ts whic h were said to be in breac h inc luded, amongst others, the following: 

 (a) The sale of five gold bars (“the Gold Bars”), whic h the plaintiff said were investment property, by the defendant without the knowledge and c onsent of the plaintiff. 

 (b) The defendant’s refusal to c ontinue repayment of the Loans through the transfer of money to the plaintiff’s ac c ount. 

 (c ) The defendant’s failure to ac c ount for the applic ation and rec eipt of the partnership funds and his unauthorised use of the funds for his personal benefit. Spec ific ally, the defendant had failed to show that he had matc hed the plaintiff’s c apital c ontribution as agreed between the parties. 


 (d) The defendant’s misrepresentation to the plaintiff that virtual gold in the form of “shares” had ac tually been purc hased from Virgin Gold Mining Corporation (“VGMC”) as part of the Business Venture. 

8       The plaintiff sought a number of orders, inc luding: 

 (a) An order that the defendant pays and indemnifies the plaintiff for the repayment of the Loans; 

 (b) An order that the defendant ac c ounts for the investment yields and the sale proc eeds of the Gold Bars; 

 (c ) An order to ac c ount for any assets ac quired with partnership funds and investment yields derived from the plaintiff’s c ontributions, and the remainder of the plaintiff’s unutilised c ontributions; 

 (d) An order that the ac c ounts of the partnership be determined and finalised; and 

 (e) An order for damages for the breac hes alleged. 

9       The plaintiff also sought an order that the partnership be dissolved and for suc h further and c onsequential orders, inc luding orders that the Kempas Properties and the Austin Residenc es be sold and the proc eeds distributed upon the ac c ounts of the partnership being determined and finalised. 

10     The defendant did not objec t to the partnership being dissolved and the ac c ounts of the partnership being determined and finalised, but disagreed that he had breac hed any partnership terms or duties. The defendant asserted that the Gold Bars were his c apital c ontribution to the business venture. There was therefore no obligation for him to make repayments for the Loans, as his c ontribution to the partnership c apital was by way of the Gold Bars while the defendant’s c apital c ontribution was by way of the sums from the Loans. The defendant ac knowledged that the Gold Bars were assets belonging to the Business Venture, but that the plaintiff had authorised his dealings in them. As for the VGMC shares, the defendant said that there was no misrepresentation as the Business Venture had in fac t ac quired at least 70,000 shares. 

**The issues** 

11     The plaintiff’s c ase c ould be desc ribed as c omprising two broad aspec ts – one relating to the terms of the Business Venture and the other relating to how the funds of the Business Venture were applied. 

12     I observed that there was in fac t a large area of agreement in terms of how the issues c ould be resolved. Both parties agreed to the partnership being dissolved and the ac c ounts of the partnership to be determined and finalised. They also agreed to the Austin Residenc es and their share in the Kempas Properties being sold and the proc eeds distributed thereafter. The partnership assets would then be distributed in ac c ordanc e with the final ac c ounts. Thus, what remained for determination were in respec t of items (a) and (e) of the orders sought at [8] above and matters whic h would enable the ac c ounting report to be meaningful so that parties c an rec eive the gains and bear the losses in ac c ordanc e with their agreement. 

13     A major point of c ontention between the parties that had to be resolved was the terms of the Business Venture, whic h would determine whether the defendant was in fac t liable for the repayment 


of the Loans and the manner in whic h the partnership assets would be distributed. An anc illary point whic h also had to be determined was the quantum of the parties’ c apital c ontributions to the Business Venture. 

14     There was also the matter of damages arising from the defendant’s breac hes as alleged by the plaintiff, but as the defendant pointed out, the plaintiff had, as at the end of the trial, led no evidenc e on losses suffered by the plaintiff outside of what would be reflec ted in the final ac c ounts of the Business Venture. Indeed, the plaintiff’s submissions only raised the prospec t of damages being awarded in respec t of the repayment of the Loans, whic h my findings on the terms of the Business Venture would deal with. Ultimately, the remedy that the plaintiff sought in respec t of the applic ation of the Business Venture funds was simply an ac c ount of the partnership dealings, whic h the defendant had already agreed to. 

15     The trial spanned two and a half days. I noted that the evidenc e in respec t of the applic ation of the partnership funds was given in the main by the defendant bec ause the defendant took the lead in investing the partnership monies. As a result of a c lose relationship of trust and c onfidenc e between the parties, the plaintiff entrusted the defendant with wide disc retion to invest the money. Additionally, the parties did not institute a formal system for the defendant to report to the plaintiff on how the monies were spent. Rather, any report to the plaintiff was made on an informal basis and often with little details. This left the plaintiff unable to c hallenge the defendant’s evidenc e. Neither did the defendant always keep supporting doc uments for the expenditures; in some plac es, there was only the defendant’s bare rec ord of the expenditures. 

16     Consequently, muc h of the evidenc e was given by the defendant. On the whole, I found that he was a c redible witness who had been forthright in terms of the transac tions that had transpired. However, not all of his ac c ount was supported by doc umentary evidenc e and I was of the view that the order of ac c ounting of the partnership would assist the parties in obtaining and produc ing further relevant evidenc e as to the assets to be distributed. I therefore gave my observations on the usage of partnership monies whic h I felt the ac c ounting report should address. 

**My Findings** 

**_The terms of the Business Venture_** 

_Capital contribution_ 

17     The plaintiff said that the arrangement between the parties was suc h that he would first c ontribute the c apital to the Business Venture through c redit fac ilities that he sec ured, and that the defendant would pay towards the c redit fac ilities until his c apital c ontribution “matc hed” the plaintiff’s. Ac c ording to the plaintiff, the defendant would also bear half of the losses inc urred by the Business Venture, as well as half of the plaintiff’s losses over and on top of that. The c umulative effec t of this was that the defendant would bear three quarters of the losses. The defendant, on the other hand, said that they had agreed that he would matc h the plaintiff’s c apital c ontribution by way of 1kg gold bars that the defendant benefic ially owned. One of suc h gold bars would be handed to the plaintiff whenever a sum equivalent to its value was transferred from the plaintiff to the defendant. The defendant’s evidenc e was that five gold bars were ultimately handed over to the plaintiff (the Gold Bars referred to in [7] above). The defendant’s position on their agreement on the sharing of profits or losses is that any gains or losses arising out of the Business Venture would be shared equally between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

18     I found the plaintiff’s ac c ount, both in relation to their respec tive c ontributions and to the profit 


or loss-sharing arrangement, to be unc onvinc ing. In respec t of the former, the plaintiff c larified during c ross-examination that what he meant by the defendant matc hing his c apital c ontribution was that the defendant would make the instalment payments for the Loans until the princ ipal amount of $536,000 was repaid. Therefore, ac c ording to the plaintiff, the obligation to repay the Loans lay solely with the defendant. This would mean, c ontrary to their agreement that c apital would be provided in equal shares, all of the c apital would be c ontributed by the defendant and the plaintiff stood to reap the rewards without having to put in a single c ent. Between the parties’ respec tive ac c ounts, it was far more likely, as the defendant said, that the defendant would matc h the c apital c ontribution of the plaintiff as ordinarily understood. The plaintiff c ontributed to the c apital through obtaining the Loans, for whic h he retained the obligation to make repayments. Some of the Loans sums were transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant as the plaintiff’s c apital c ontribution to the Business Venture. The defendant, on his part, matc hed the plaintiff’s c ontribution by c ontributing the Gold Bars. 

19     I noted that the Gold Bars were held in the name of the defendant’s mother, Ms Ong Choon Wan Franc esc a. Her evidenc e was that the defendant had merely borrowed her Identity Card to buy the Gold Bars in her name and that she had not c ontributed at all to the purc hase. She ac knowledged the defendant to be the benefic ial owner of the Gold Bars, and there was little basis for the plaintiff to c ontend otherwise. It was important to note that some of the Gold Bars had already been purc hased by 28 February 2012, before the parties entered into the Business Venture and before the plaintiff had obtained the c redit fac ilities. This was inc ongruent with the plaintiff’s ac c ount that the Gold Bars were ac quired using his c apital c ontribution. 

_Sharing of profits and losses_ 

20     It was not disputed that the profits would be shared equally. As for how the losses would be borne by the parties, the plaintiff pointed to a written agreement between the parties, whic h stated: 

 LIAN FOO KUAN DAVID is liable to half of any losses in all investments inc lusive AND HOLDING CASH OF SGD$550,000 whether personal or partnership or under GLOBAL KPP PTE LTD. 

21     The plaintiff argued that the above should be interpreted to mean that the defendant would bear half of the business losses and further, half of the portion of the plaintiff’s losses. I disagreed with suc h an interpretation. A plain and reasonable reading of the term was that the parties would share the business losses equally, whic hever form they may take, inc luding losses personally inc urred by the parties on behalf of the partnership. In my view therefore, the parties had agreed to share the profits and losses of the partnership equally. This was also supported by a “WhatsApp” message from the plaintiff’s wife to the defendant, in whic h she stated that “[a]ll profit and los[s] are shared equally between both parties on the pool of 536k” and that the parties “own the risk and return together”. 

22     Ultimately, I observed that the arrangement that the plaintiff c laimed was entered into would have effec tively resulted in him only having to obtain the c redit fac ilities without bearing the obligation to repay or to c ontribute substantively to the Business Venture by providing funds. In return, he would rec eive half of the profits, but bear only 25% of the losses with the remaining 75% borne by the defendant. In the absenc e of any doc umentary evidenc e of suc h an agreement, I found it unlikely that an agreement between two equals would have resulted in suc h unequal terms. Ac c ordingly, I held that the defendant had not breac hed any duty or the terms of the partnership agreement by his failure to repay or c ontribute to the repayment of the Loans. 

**_The quantum of the parties’ capital contributions_** 


23     The plaintiff submitted and the defendant agreed that the plaintiff had obtained c redit fac ilities of the sum of $536,000. Notwithstanding this, I was satisfied by the evidenc e adduc ed that the plaintiff had transferred more than this sum to the defendant. This total sum of $591,830 c onsisted of: 

 (a) $497,830 transferred from the plaintiff to the defendant in six tranc hes between 30 April and 28 June 2012, 

 (b) $45,000, whic h the defendant ac c epts was transferred to him by the plaintiff in three tranc hes between 10 and 14 Dec ember 2012; and 

 (c ) $49,000 transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant on 22 June 2012. 

24     As for the sum of $38,170 that the plaintiff c laimed was also transferred to the defendant, I found that there was insuffic ient evidenc e to support it. The plaintiff had admitted during c rossexamination that this sum of $38,170 was “a balanc ing number”. This was derived from the differenc e between the sum of $536,000 whic h the plaintiff borrowed from the banks and the sum of $497, whic h the plaintiff transferred to the defendant during the first half of 2012. The plaintiff’s c ase was that he must have transferred all the money he borrowed from the banks to the defendant. However, in c ontrast to the above transfers, there was no doc umentary evidenc e of him having transferred $38,170 to the defendant. All that the plaintiff c ould point to was a deposit slip evidenc ing a deposit of $18,600 whic h, as he c onc eded during c ross-examination, c ould not have c ome from the c redit fac ilities given that it predated the c redit fac ilities. I therefore disregarded this alleged sum in assessing the plaintiff’s c apital c ontribution, whic h I found to be $591,830 in total. 

25     As for the defendant, my finding at [18]-[19] above meant that his c apital c ontributions would be measured by the value of the Gold Bars. The “unit pric e” and “future buy-bac k value” of the Gold Bars as reflec ted in the invoic es from Genneva Pte Ltd (“Genneva”) supported the defendant’s submission that they were worth $95,000 eac h at the time of his c ontribution. Thus I found that the defendant had c ontributed $475,000 (the c ombined value of the Gold Bars) to the Business Venture. 

26     In view of my finding that the agreement between the parties was to make equal c ontributions to the partnership, in so far as one party had not met that agreement, he remained liable to make good the shortfall. Based on my findings as to the parties’ respec tive c apital c ontributions, I found that the defendant had not c ontributed a value equal to that c ontributed by the plaintiff. The defendant c ontributed $116,830 ($591,830 – $475,000) less than the plaintiff. This amount should be taken into ac c ount in the distribution of the partnership assets as a sum owed by the defendant to the partnership. 

**My orders** 

27     With the c onsent of both parties, I ordered that the ac c ounts of the partnership be determined and finalised and that the partnership be dissolved. An ac c ounting or auditing firm that both parties agreed on would be appointed to produc e a report of the ac c ounts of the partnership. Onc e the ac c ounts have been finalised, the parties would share the partnership’s profits and assets and bear the losses equally. The aspec ts of the partnership ac c ounts that the ac c ounting report shall inc lude are set out further below in my observations. 

28     Similarly, I ordered that the shares of the partnership in the Austin Residenc es and the Kempas Properties be sold and the proc eeds divided equally between the parties. 


29     Finally, the plaintiff had not proven that he had suffered any losses outside of what would be reflec ted in the final ac c ounts of the Business Venture. I therefore made no order for damages. 

**Observations on the use of the Business Venture assets** 

**_Austin Residences_** 

30     The doc umentary evidenc e showed that the downpayments made in respec t of the Austin Residenc es were in the sums of RM 189,000 (for Lot 499091) and RM 187,400 (for Lot 499082) respec tively. The c osts of the purc hases, inc luding c ommission, legal fees and the like, amounted to RM 36,119.65 (for Lot 499091) and RM 36,111.65 (for Lot 499082) respec tively. 

31     The ac c ounting report should determine whether partnership monies or the parties’ personal funds were applied towards these sums. 

**_Kempas shophouse_** 

32     The partnership purc hased a 47.5% stake in the Kempas shophouse from Rowmark (M) Sdn Bhd. The doc umentary evidenc e showed that the sums of RM 45,362.50 and RM 8,210.21 were paid to Rowmark (M) Sdn Bhd. These sums c onstituted its share of the downpayment of RM 91,500 and the c osts of the purc hase respec tively. 

33     Again, the ac c ounting report should determine whether partnership monies or the parties’ personal funds were applied towards these sums. 

**_VGMC shares_** 

34     The plaintiff suggested that the defendant may not have ac quired any VGMC shares for the partnership bec ause there was no doc umentary support of the same, but I found this to be without merit. I referred in partic ular to a text message sent by the defendant to the plaintiff on 12 July 2012 whic h read: “Sold bac k today to inc rease c ash... We need 2 million c ash for 10 million loan. V g faster... But we got enough... Of v g... We need to put it as liquid c ash...”. This was followed by another text message on an unrelated matter of “get[ting] the c ompany up” and to whic h the plaintiff responded “I meet the lawyers on mon and will set it up. I will sc out around for the prospec tive properties in the meantime.” The lac k of response by the plaintiff to the defendant’s referenc e to “v g”, whic h in this c ontext c learly related to VGMC shares, showed that they had c ontemplated the purc hase of the VGMC shares and that the purc hase was eventually made with the plaintiff’s knowledge and without his objec tion. More importantly, the memoranda signed by both parties also referred to at least 70,000 shares being purc hased and managed by the defendant. The messages and memoranda also indic ated, c ontrary to what the plaintiff appeared to have suggested, that the VGMC shares were bought on behalf of the Business Venture and not for the plaintiff in his personal c apac ity. 

35     There was nevertheless unc ertainty as to the exac t number of shares that had been purc hased. The ac c ounting report should therefore determine the number of VGMC shares ac quired and how muc h was paid for these shares, as well as the dividends rec eived in respec t of these shares. 

**_The Gold Bars_** 

36     As set out at [18] above, I found that the defendant had c ontributed the Gold Bars as c apital 


for the partnership. I also ac c epted that the Gold Bars had been sold – payment vouc hers adduc ed by the defendant showed that they were sold on 22 and 23 Oc tober 2012 for the c ombined sum of $336,100. Additionally, pawn rec eipts adduc ed by the defendant also indic ated that the Gold Bars had been pawned off and redeemed on more than one oc c asion. 

37     The plaintiff c ontended that he did not authorise the defendant to deal in the Gold Bars in any way save for the presentation of the Gold Bars to Genneva for the purpose of rec eiving dividends. But this is inc onsistent with the c ontemporaneous text messages. On 12 July 2012, the Plaintiff sent the Defendant a text message “All ok Bro. Was it pawned or sold bac k to [Genneva]”. It appears that the plaintiff was responding to information earlier c ommunic ated to him that the partnership might need to liquidate the Gold Bars, and was merely enquiring about the details after knowing that the transac tion had been done. In my view, the fac t that the plaintiff did not even know if the Gold Bars were pawned off or sold supports the defendant’s ac c ount that he had been authorised to deal in the Gold Bars as he saw fit. 

38     An ac c ount should therefore be taken of the yields from the Gold Bars by way of the dividend payments and the sums involved in eac h pawn transac tion. The use of the proc eeds from the sale of the Gold Bars should also be the subjec t of the ac c ounting report. 

**_Global KPP_** 

39     Although it appeared to be c ommon ground that none of the investments were transac ted through Global KPP, it was not without assets and the defendant ac c epted that they belonged to the Business Venture. An ac c ount should therefore be taken of the financ ial position of Global KPP. 

**_Monies transferred by the defendant to the plaintiff_** 

40     The defendant’s evidenc e, whic h was supported by c onfirmations sent elec tronic ally, was that he had transferred a total of $285,625.99 to the plaintiff’s personal ac c ount. Indeed, it was not disputed by the plaintiff that he had rec eived the money. However, the plaintiff’s position was that they were not loans. The defendant, on the other hand, said that they were to “help [the plaintiff ] to servic e his loans and his other personal financ ial c ommitments”. 

41     Given the above unc ertainty, an ac c ount should be taken of whether the sum c onsisted of partnership monies, partnership investment yields and/or the defendant’s personal funds. 

**Conclusion** 

42     On 26 February 2016, I heard parties on the appointment of the ac c ountant as well as further arguments on c osts. I appointed Reanda Adept PAC to undertake the ac c ounting exerc ise and ordered c osts fixed at $37,500 to be paid to the Defendant. 

43     Apart from what will be reflec ted in the ac c ounting report, I found that the plaintiff had, as at the end of the trial, not proved that he had suffered any losses arising from the defendant’s breac hes as alleged. I therefore made no order for damages. Onc e the ac c ounts are finalised, the parties shall share the partnership’s profits and assets and bear the losses equally.
