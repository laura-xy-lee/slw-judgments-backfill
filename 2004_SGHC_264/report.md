**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       The plaintiff, Mic hael Anh Nguyen, and the defendant, Serial System Ltd, are engaged in the elec tronic industry. 

2       The plaintiff started as a researc h and development engineer for Hewlett Pac kard Co in California and then he joined Hewlett Pac kard Singapore Pte Ltd. Eventually, he bec ame a shareholder and direc tor of Omni Peripherals Pte Ltd (“Omni”). 

3       Omni was wound up pursuant to a direc tors’ resolution dated 23 May 2000 when its venture c apitalist investors/shareholders dec ided not to injec t further funds into the c ompany needed for it to c ontinue its operations. The plaintiff went to work with the defendant. He sec ured his position mainly on the strength of his ability, and an invention and patent he brought with him whic h were expec ted to be developed to great advantage for the defendant. 

4       The plaintiff joined the defendant as its Direc tor, Strategic Produc t Development. His wife, Julie Thu Nguyen (“Julie Nguyen”) was appointed alternate direc tor to him. Under a servic e agreement dated 5 September 2000 (“the servic e agreement”) inc orporating an assignment of patents (“the patent assignment”), the plaintiff assigned to the defendant an invention (“the Invention”) and his rights, title and interest in Singapore Patent Applic ation No 200004835-5 dated 25 August 2000 (“the Patent Applic ation”) in respec t of the Invention. The defendant paid the plaintiff $1.4m for the assignment. 

5       The plaintiff was to rec eive $1.8m for the assignment of the Invention and the Patent Applic ation, whic h was to be paid: 

 (i) on the Produc tion Date, new shares in the share c apital of [the defendant] of an aggregate market value of $600,000/-; 

 (ii) after 12 months of the Produc tion Date, new shares in the share c apital of [the defendant] of an aggregate market value of $600,000/-; and 

 (iii) after 24 months of the Produc tion Date, new shares in the share c apital of [the 


 defendant] of an aggregate market value of $600,000/-. 

6       The plaintiff’s employment with the defendant was terminated summarily on 26 September 

2002\. The first lot of the new shares were issued to the plaintiff on 3 July 2001. The sec ond and third tranc hes were not issued. 

7       In this ac tion, the plaintiff c laimed against the defendant the remaining two lots of shares, unpaid salary for September 2002, two months’ salary in lieu of notic e for the termination of his servic es, and the defendant’s Central Provident Fund c ontributions for those payments. 

8       The c laim met with a vigorous response from the defendant. The c ritic al parts of its defenc e in the hearing before me were that the plaintiff was not the owner of the Invention bec ause it was developed or substantially developed when the plaintiff was a direc tor and employee of Omni, and that his servic es were terminated properly. 

9       The defendant went further and made a c ounterc laim against the plaintiff to c anc el the first tranc he of shares that had been issued to the plaintiff, or for the sum of $600,000 or the market value of the shares, and for the rec overy of the $1.4m it paid the plaintiff for the assignment of the Invention and the Patent Applic ation. 

10     The full defenc e was not raised at the hearing bec ause the parties agreed to proc eed with a preliminary issue. The agreement was that the issue of the plaintiff’s title to the Invention and the Patent Applic ation, inc luding the plaintiff’s disc losure to Omni, was to be tried first. If the defendant were to suc c eed on this issue, the defendant would limit its c ounterc laim to the $1.4m paid for the Invention and the Patent Applic ation and the shares issued to the plaintiff. 

11     In May1999, while he drew up a business plan for Omni, the plaintiff was thinking about developing a new produc t. Under the plan, the c ompany was to disengage from working on CDRW drives and DVD drives it had been working on and to foc us its efforts to develop a personal storage solution (“PSS”), envisaged as a “universal mobile storage solution for individual”. A c ritic al feature for the PSS was its network plug-and-play fac ility, _ie_ the ability to be c onnec ted to a network of c omputers without having to undergo a c omplex installation proc edure. 

12     At that time, Omni was unable to financ e the projec t alone. The c ompany was very low on funds. It was projec ted that it would run out of funds by June 2000. As the shareholders were not prepared to injec t more funds into the c ompany, the c ompany had to seek out parties who were prepared to ac quire the c ompany or to merge with it. The plaintiff was given the task of looking for a white knight. The defendant was one of the parties the plaintiff approac hed. 

13     In August 1999, the plaintiff made a presentation to the defendant whic h inc luded a “Produc t Round-map” whic h desc ribed three versions of the PSS inc orporating a CD-RW drive or a DVD drive. 

14     As the talks c ontinued, the development of the system c arried on. By 29 Dec ember 1999, Omni issued a set of spec ific ations on its Personal Storage System-1 or PSS-1 whic h the plaintiff referred to as “Omni’s Eagle projec t”. In the spec ific ations, the objec tive of the PSS-1 or Eagle projec t was desc ribed to be: 

 ... to provide the means for storing data that are: 

 Low c ost per byte – c osts less than $0.01 per mega-bytes of data Robust – c an withstand harsh c ondition of daily c onsumer handling and various environmental c onditions.

 Interoperability – c an work ac ross different c omputing and elec tronic s applianc e platform. Removable – storage media c an be remove [ sic ] to provide ease of data exc hange and sharing. Person c entric design – c an work with various personal elec tronic s applianc e without a PC 

15     In an e-mail dated 4 April 2000, the plaintiff informed the defendant’s Senior Vic e President, Chin Yeow Hon, that: 

 OP’s system involve a c omplete storage c omputer OS. With the defined API (applic ation protoc ol interfac e) and standard high speed I/O [input/output] port, our platform would allow other peripherals to c onnec t direc tly to our devic e. Whether it is a c amera, MP3 player, c ard reader, modem, WLAN, Bluetooth, MPEG-2 dec oder, Card Camera, etc. You c an let your and the rest of the world’s developer imagination go wild on this![ sic ] 

16     On 24 April 2000, Omni demonstrated a “proof-of-c onc ept” prototype of the system whic h was desc ribed as Omni’s “Personal Storage Computer System” to the defendant’s offic ers. The prototype demonstrated was able to download and upload digital photographs from and to digital c ameras, to rec ognise different devic es plugged into it, and to play bac k MP3 files. At the demonstration, there was a disc ussion on developing a devic e with a hard disk drive (“HDD”) running on a Linux operating system (“OS”). 

17     The plaintiff rec alled that: 

 Toward the end of the meeting, I was asked about how would I respond to Eagle’s potential c ompetition from several new or about to be introduc ed PSS/PSC type produc ts in the market at that time. I tossed up several ideas suc h as CDRW engine with a built-in digital c amera or digital c amc order, CDRW engine with a built-in video movie playbac k bac k-end for playing bac k VCD or DVD movie disc with more powerful built in software or the use of a more sophistic ated OS that probably would require a HDD. 

18     This was followed up by Omni on 26 April 2000 when it faxed to the defendant a doc ument entitled “mySTOR-1000 Development Sc hedule Rev 0.1”. MyStor-1000 and Eagle referred to the same produc t, the former being the marketing name, and the latter the internal development name. This development sc hedule rec orded that the relianc e on or utilisation of a Linux OS c ore was being c ontemplated. 

19     On 2 May 2000, the defendant offered to buy Omni for $1m, with an additional issue of $2m worth of the defendant’s shares to Omni’s management “to be made after the Eagle Projec t or the personal storage c omputer is released for mass produc tion”. The $1m c omponent was inc reased to $1.4m on 11 May 2000. 

20     The offer was not taken up. The defendant led evidenc e that the offer was not c onveyed to Omni by the plaintiff or his wife, Julie Nguyen, who was princ ipally involved in the effort to proc ure an investor or a merger prospec t. Julie Nguyen c laimed that she kept Omni’s board updated and informed by e-mails, fax, telephone c onversations and meetings. 

21     Thomas Kalon Ng (“Thomas Ng”), c hairman of Omni’s board of direc tors and the representative of Venture TDF Pte Ltd (“TDF”), a venture c apitalist/c orporate shareholder of Omni, gave evidenc e that he was not told of any offers from the defendant. He assigned the Direc tor of Investment of TDF, Darren Ho, to review Omni’s prospec ts and to advise Omni on any prospec tive merger proposals. Darren Ho testified that he was not informed of the defendant’s offers. There was no doc umented rec ord that the plaintiff or Julie Nguyen had forwarded, c ommunic ated or even alluded to any of the defendant’s offers. It was not disputed that Julie Nguyen rec eived the inc reased offer

by e-mail on 11 May 2000, and she informed the plaintiff of it, but neither she nor the plaintiff referred the e-mail to Darren Ho, Thomas Ng or Omni. 

22     When I reviewed the evidenc e on this issue, I ac c epted that there was no reason for Darren Ho to withhold informing Thomas Ng, TDF or Omni of any offers from the defendant if Julie Nguyen had told him of them. Similarly, if the plaintiff, Julie Nguyen or Darren Ho had told Thomas Ng of any offer, he would have been in derelic tion of duty if he did not advise the Omni board. If the offer was known to the board, it was unlikely to dec ide to wind up the c ompany without disc ussing the offer. Further to that, the lac k of any rec ord of c ommunic ation of the offer from Julie Nguyen to Darren Ho (when there was rec ord of other c ommunic ations between them) led me to c onc lude that the plaintiff and Julie Nguyen had kept the offers away from Omni, Darren Ho and Thomas Ng. I do not ac c ept the plaintiff’s explanation that some of the rec ords were unavailable after Omni was wound up. 

23     Julie Nguyen did c onvey one offer to Omni. This was her own offer for a management buyout. On 8 May 2000, Julie Nguyen sent an e-mail to Omni’s board members, offering to buy all shares of Omni not belonging to the plaintiff for $200,000 or Omni’s net tangible assets as at 31 May 2000, whic hever was the lower. 

24     The board c onsidered the offer, and was prepared to c onsider it on two c onditions. The first c ondition was that the proc eeds of any sale or lic ensing of Omni’s intellec tual property rights, or of the sale of the plaintiff’s or Julie Nguyen’s shares within nine months from the management buyout be shared with the original c orporate shareholders. The sec ond c ondition was for an undertaking from the plaintiff that he had made full disc losure of all offers for Omni or its assets from third parties. 

25     Thomas Ng explained that the c onditions were proposed to prevent the plaintiff and Julie Nguyen from making a “quic k flip” _ie_ buying Omni at a low pric e and making a quic k profit by selling it at a higher pric e. 

26     When these c onditions were rejec ted, the management buyout fell through and the board resolved on 19 May 2000 to wind up the c ompany. 

27     While no progress was made on the defendant’s offer, disc ussions went on between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff informed the defendant of the failed management buyout and the pending winding-up of Omni. They disc ussed developing the personal storage c omputer (“PSC”) together. The proposal was for the plaintiff and his team at Omni involved in the PSC projec t to join the defendant and c arry on the projec t there. 

28     In June 2000, the plaintiff made a flash and PowerPoint presentation to Omni of a projec t named mySTOR-1000 desc ribed as an “Intelligent Storage Devic e Sec ure data management Personal Centric Storage”. 

29     The presentation did not result in any agreement between Omni and the defendant. By 17 July 2000, the plaintiff’s employment with Omni was terminated. By that time, the winding up of Omni was underway. Arrangements were made to distribute the assets of the c ompany among the shareholders. In that exerc ise, the plaintiff did not bring up to the Omni board and the liquidators the rights and interests in the PSC that was under development from 1999 to May 2000, and they were not inc luded in the assets of the c ompany. Consequently the rights to the development were not transferred to any of the shareholders or dealt with in any manner. 

30     After Omni was wound up, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into the servic e agreement and the patent assignment on 5 September 2000. 

## [11] 


31     Under c l 3.1(a) of the patent assignment, the plaintiff agreed to assign to the defendant: 

 ... free from all enc umbranc es all of [his] rights, title and interest in and to the Invention and Patent and all patents granted thereon (if any) together with all intellec tual property rights and other rights and powers arising or ac c rued therefrom inc luding the right to sue for damages and other remedies in respec t of any infringement of suc h rights or other ac ts within the sc ope of the c laims of any published spec ific ations of the Patents. 

and warranted under c l 5(a) that he was: 

 ... the legal and benefic ial owner of the Patent and has full rights and power to enter into [the patent assignment] and to assign the Patent in favour of the [defendant] free from all enc umbranc es and c ompeting interests of third parties. 

32     The importanc e of the Patent Applic ation to the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant is spelt out in c l 2.3 of the servic e agreement: 

 This Agreement is entered into on the primary basis of the [plaintiff ] exec uting and assigning the Patents to the [defendant] as at set out under Sc hedule 2 (Assignment of Patents Agreement) of this Agreement, of whic h the Assignment of Patents Agreement forms a part thereof. If for any reason the [plaintiff ] does not assign the Patents to the [defendant] or if the [defendant] fails to pay the full c ash c onsideration therefor in ac c ordanc e with the Assignment, this Agreement shall forthwith c ease and determine and be of no effec t and neither party shall have any c laim against the other in respec t of suc h termination. In addition, if any of the parties to this Agreement does not perform their respec tive obligations under this Agreement, inc luding the obligations under the Assignment this Agreement shall ipso fac to c ease to be of effec t but without prejudic e to either party’s rights to sue for any breac h and loss following therefrom. 

33     Development work on the PSC progressed. On 21 July 2000, the plaintiff issued in the name of SmartStor System Pte Ltd (“SmartStor”), a c ompany c ontrolled by him, a doc ument entitled “Arawana User Desc ription” whic h desc ribed “Arawana” as the c ode name for SmartStor’s personal storage c omputer. The Arawana name, however, was not new, and had appeared at the foot of the mySTOR1000 Development Sc hedule Rev 0.1 of 26 April 2000 referred to in [18] above. A doc ument issued by 

SmartStor entitled “Arawana Program Rev 3 – 21st July, 2000” disc losed that the program was first released on 3 July 2000. It was evident that the plaintiff had c reated the Arawana name by April 2000 in c onnec tion with Omni’s personal storage c omputer when he was with the c ompany, and then applied it to SmartStor’s PSC by 3 July 2000, when he was still employed by Omni. 

34     On the same day, 21 July 2000, the plaintiff instruc ted patent attorneys Lawrenc e Y D Ho & Assoc iates Pte Ltd to ac t in the applic ation. The applic ation No 200004835-5 was filed on 25 August 2000. 

35     Another doc ument, an Invention Disc losure for a Personal Storage Computer, was issued on 22 July 2000 in c onnec tion with the applic ation. 

36     The defendant disputed the plaintiff’s title to the Invention. It alleged that the plaintiff was not the owner of the Invention, or all the rights, title and interest in the Invention. 

37     Paragraph 18 of the Re-Re-Amended Defenc e and Counterc laim alleged that: 

 [I]t was also an implied term of the Servic e Agreement that the Plaintiff was the legal and 


 benefic ial owner of the Invention and the Patent and/or all rights, title and interest in and to the Invention and Patent and all intellec tual property rights and all rights and powers arising and/or ac c rued therefrom, and was entitled to assign the same to the Defendants. 

and para 21 alleged that: 

 [T]he Plaintiff was not the legal and benefic ial owner of the Invention and the Patent, and/or did not have full rights and powers to enter into the Assignment and/or to assign the Patent in favour of the Defendants free from enc umbranc es and c ompeting interests of third parties. 

38     In its defenc e, the defendant referred to the servic e agreement between the plaintiff and Omni dated 30 April 1998. Clauses 2.1 and 2.3 stipulated that: 

 2.1 The Employee shall c arry out and undertake suc h duties and exerc ise suc h powers and func tions in relation to the Company and its business as its Board of Direc tors (the “Board”) shall from time to time assign to or vest in him and shall c arry out other duties normally expec ted of a Managing Direc tor. 

 2.3 During his employment hereunder, the Employee shall not without the prior written c onsent of the Company (suc h c onsent not to be unreasonably withheld) be engaged in any c apac ity in any other employment, freelanc e work or c onsultanc y. 

39     The defendant read this together with the further provision in Sc hedule 2 of the agreement that: 

 If at any time during the term of employment with the Company (the “Employment”), the Employee (either alone or with others): makes or disc overs any invention, development, proc ess or sec ret whatsoever whether patentable or not (hereinafter c alled “Inventions”); or produc es any work in any medium whatever inc luding any design, model, drawing, doc ument, plan, tape or photograph and whether in two or three dimension (hereinafter c alled “Designs”) whic h relates to any of the produc ts or methods of produc tion of the Company or otherwise to the business of the Company or whic h results from or is suggested by anything done in the c ourse of the Employment, then all rights in suc h Inventions and Designs shall be the sole and absolute property of the Company and the Employee shall without delay c ommunic ate and deliver up to the Company all available information and materials relating to Inventions and deliver up to the Company all Designs. 

40     The plaintiff agreed that by this provision, any produc t whic h resulted from or was suggested by anything done in the c ourse of his employment with Omni was the property of Omni. He also agreed that if he wanted to undertake any other employment, freelanc e work or c onsultanc y in the c ourse of his employment with Omni, he would have to obtain Omni’s c onsent. 

41     The defendant’s c ase was that any work leading to the Invention that was done up to 17 July 2000 when the plaintiff was in the employ of Omni was the property of Omni. 

42     The plaintiff disagreed with that on the ground that the servic e agreement with Omni did not prevent him from working in his own time on the development work leading to the Invention and that the Invention had nothing to do with the development work on the PSC undertaken by Omni. 

43     He pleaded that Omni had c eased operations on 30 June 2000 and his employment c eased on 17 July 2000 and that he c ommenc ed work c onc eptualising the Invention on 3 July and “[i]n the 


premises, the Invention was not developed or substantially developed while [he] was an employee of Omni”. 

44     He pleaded alternatively that if the Invention was developed or substantially developed while he was an employee of Omni, the Invention did not relate to “any of the produc ts or methods of produc tion of Omni” or “whic h resulted from or was suggested by anything done in the c ourse of the Plaintiff’s employment with Omni”. 

45     In his affidavit, the plaintiff deposed that the original produc t he was working on in Omni was the Eagle. While the disc ussions with the defendant were underway, the projec t took a different direc tion from the optic al based Eagle to “a new produc t c onc ept Arawana to be based on Linux OS and a HDD” whic h was presented to the defendant in June 2000. (This was in fac t something he had c onsidered sinc e April 2000, see [16] above). He went on to explain that in July 2000 he drafted the produc t spec ific ation for Arawana, whic h he sent to the patent attorneys on 21 July. 

46     In his opening statement, the plaintiff took pains to explain the c onc epts that he had gone through: 

 For the sake of not c onfusing the Court, I would like to highlight the IP issue relates to 3 fundamental different produc t c onc epts whic h resulted in 3 different inventions: 

 (i) Omni’s Eagle func tional prototype that was demonstrated to the Defendant in April 2000 and was a storage device based on CD-RW drive. 

 (ii) After the Omni was dec ided to wind down, the June’s produc t c onc ept that was presented on around mid June 2000 to the Defendant by way of an animated multimedia presentation. This c onc ept was a storage device based on a hard disk drive and Linux OS. The July 2000’s Invention Disc losure was filed for this c onc ept with the name “Personal Storage Computer”. 

 (iii) The Tec hnic al Produc t’s invention that was developed and filed in August 2000 is an invention of a c ompletely different paradigm with the primary purpose of directing flows of data between different digital devices. Therefore its name is “Rec onfigurable Communic ation Interfac e and Method Thereof”. This is the Invention/Patent that was assigned to the Defendant and was developed for the Defendant. 

 [emphasis added] 

To paraphrase that, the first and sec ond produc t c onc epts (whic h were named “Eagle” or “mySTOR1000”) were for a storage devic e while the third produc t c onc ept (whic h was c alled “Arawana”) was for a data flow system. 

47     It appears from the plaintiff’s affidavit and the opening statement that the c onc ept for the Invention, in partic ular, the c hange from an optic al-based produc t to one using the Linux OS and a HDD was first thought of in April 2000 and born in June 2000 while Omni was still in operation, and while the plaintiff was an employee of Omni working ac tively on improving the Eagle/mySTOR-1000, and seeking to nurture the defendant’s interest in the developments. 

48     The plaintiff fac ed diffic ulties in this part of his c ase. When did he first think of switc hing from a CD-RW engine to a more sophistic ated OS? Was it during the April presentation, or in June as stated in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief, or on 3 July, as pleaded? Whether it was April, June or 3 July, he 

## [12]

## [16] 


was still under the employ of Omni. More importantly, the switc h-over was part of a c ontinuous proc ess of developing the projec t that the plaintiff was heading in Omni, whic h had been mentioned sinc e April. There was no basis for severing the work done before 3 July from the work done after that day while he was still in the employ of Omni. It is diffic ult to believe that the Eagle/mySTORprojec t under development sinc e May 1999 was c ompletely abandoned without any result when Omni was wound up in July 2000, while work on the Invention from sc ratc h on 3 July 2000 progressed to the extent that steps were already taken on 21 July 2000 to get a patent applic ation filed. 

49     The issue c annot be disposed of without c onsidering the tec hnic al question whether the Invention was the plaintiff’s own work, or whether it was developed or substantially developed during his time with Omni. 

50     The defendant engaged Timothy Watkin (“Watkin”) to give expert evidenc e. Watkin is a partner of a firm of patent and trademark attorneys in Singapore. He is a Chartered Patent Agent of UK, a European Patent Attorney and a Singapore Registered Patent Agent, and has been engaged in patent work inc luding patent drafting for more than ten years. 

51     He was instruc ted to render his opinion on whether the Patent Applic ation and Invention were so similar to the invention developed by Omni as to entitle Omni to maintain a c laim in the Patent Applic ation assuming that the plaintiff did base the Invention on the Omni invention. 

52     Watkin was provided with a series of doc uments, inc luding notably a print-out of a mySTOR1000 PowerPoint presentation of June 2000, an Arawana Program Desc ription dated 12 July 2000, an Arawana User Desc ription dated 21 July 2000 and the Invention Disc losure dated 22 July 2000. 

53     He was also asked to work from some assumed fac ts. Princ ipally, he was to assume that mySTOR-1000/Eagle was an Omni invention and that Arawana was the Invention for whic h the Patent Applic ation was filed on 25 August 2000. 

54     His opinion was that mySTOR-1000/Eagle was substantially similar to the Invention suc h that Omni was entitled to maintain an interest or c laim on the Patent Applic ation and the plaintiff was unable to transfer the Invention and Patent Applic ation and the assoc iated intellec tual property rights to the defendant free from enc umbranc es. 

55     In his report, Watkin identified the three paragraphs in the Patent Applic ation where the independent c laims were made. He examined the features of mySTOR-1000/Eagle and the Arawana, and he found that: 

 mySTOR-1000 is substantially similar to Arawana and both are very similar to the Invention as desc ribed in ... the Patent Applic ation. In view of the Assumed Fac ts, Arawana is an advanc ed development from mySTOR-1000 and the Invention and Patent Applic ation are ultimately based upon the c onc epts embodied in mySTOR-1000. 

56     The plaintiff disputed Watkin’s findings. He c hallenged the assumptions on whic h Watkin had worked and raised matters over the produc ts that were under c ontemplation at the different stages. However, he was not able to show that the assumed fac ts Watkin relied on were materially wrong, and muc h of his c omplaints arose bec ause he took some time to ac c ept that the sc ope and depth of a patent applic ation are to be established from the c laims set out in the applic ation, not from the inventor’s intentions. The plaintiff questioned Watkin on the major parts of his report, but the latter stood by his opinion. 

## [17] 

## [18] 


57     I believe that the plaintiff would have dealt with Watkin’s evidenc e more effec tively if he had an expert to assist him at the trial, but he only dec ided to c all patent attorney Kevin Theseira (“Theseira”) as his witness after Watkin had c ompleted his evidenc e. 

58     Theseira was responsible for drafting the Patent Applic ation. His evidenc e, in the form of a signed statement, was that the plaintiff had wanted a patent for a personal storage c omputer, but he advised him that it would be diffic ult to obtain bec ause there were many prior art devic es. After further disc ussions, they agreed that the applic ation was to be foc used on a rec onfigurable c ommunic ation interfac e for c onnec ting different devic es together. 

59     When c ounsel for the defendant referred him to the e-mail of 4 April 2000 (see [15] above), Theseira agreed that it showed that the plaintiff was already foc using on c onnec tivity with external devic es at that time. 

60     Theseira also supported the plaintiff’s c ontention that data flow was a c ritic al part of the Invention. He pointed out that data flow was referred to under “Brief Summary of Invention” in the applic ation. But c ounsel pointed out to him that it was not a c laim for whic h protec tion was sought. This is a signific ant omission as s 25(5) of the Patents Ac t (Cap 221, 1995 Rev Ed) stipulates that the c laims shall define the matters for whic h an applic ant seeks protec tion. He also agreed that the Abstrac t in the applic ation did not mention data flow although r 22(3) of the Patents Rules (Cap 221, R 1, 1996 Rev Ed) requires the Abstrac t to give a c lear understanding of the tec hnic al problem to whic h the invention relates. The omission indic ates that the foc us of the Invention is not on data flow. 

61     These c onc essions undermined the basis for saying that data flow is an essential part of the Invention, or that the Invention is fundamentally different from mySTOR-1000/Eagle in that the Invention is a data flow devic e while mySTOR-1000/Eagle is a storage devic e. 

62     The defendant was able to obtain from the patent attorneys their file in the Patent Applic ation. In that file there is an e-mail from the plaintiff dated 5 August 2000 attac hing “the overview system bloc k diagrams and flow c harts of key func tion”. Amongst them was a c hart of the Arawana bearing the notation “Overview 7 May 00, Rev 0.1”. This is a telling revelation indic ating that there was already a c onnec tion between the work undertaken by May 2000 and the Invention, that the Arawana c onc ept was born by May, and that work on the Invention did not c ommenc e on 3 July as the plaintiff c laimed. 

**Findings** 

63     I find on a review of the evidenc e, that Arawana was a progression from mySTOR1000/Eagle, and that it was c onc eived and worked on in April/May 2000 at the latest. 

64     I rejec t the plaintiff’s c laim that work on the Invention only started on 3 July, but even if it did, the intellec tual property arising out of the work undertaken between 3 July and 17 July, when he was employed by Omni, belonged to the c ompany. 

65     My findings are reinforc ed by the questionable c onduc t of the plaintiff and his wife in not informing the direc tors of Omni of the defendant’s offer, and in not listing mySTOR-1000/Eagle in the assets of Omni in its winding up. It showed that they did not have the interests of Omni at heart when they realised that the c ompany might not be able to c arry on its operations, and that they were ac ting to advanc e their own interests instead.

66     I ac c ept Watkin’s opinion that mySTOR-1000/Eagle is substantially similar to the Invention, and I find that by the terms of his servic e agreement with Omni, the plaintiff did not have the full title to the Invention or the Patent Applic ation that he purported to assign to the defendant. 

67     In the result, I find in favour of the defendant on the preliminary issue and order that the plaintiff pay c osts to the defendant for the proc eedings before me. The parties are to return before me for direc tions on the c onduc t of the rest of the ac tion that may be needed.
