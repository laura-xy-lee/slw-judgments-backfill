: In this c ase, the appellants appealed against the dec ision of the Inc ome Tax Board of Review, whic h dismissed their appeal against the refusal of the respondent, the Comptroller of Inc ome Tax, to amend two Notic es of Assessment dated 18 November 1994 requiring the appellants to pay the sums of $2,115,234 and $122,056.11 for the 1986 and 1989 years of assessment. I dismissed the appellants` appeal and now give my reasons for doing so. 

**_Background_** 

The appellants are the sole proprietors of the Pinetree Town & Country Club (hereinafter referred to as `the c lub`), whic h is situated at 30, Stevens Road, Singapore. The c lub provides soc ial, rec reational and sporting fac ilities to its members. Sinc e its inc eption, members of the c lub have had to pay an entranc e fee to join it. In Dec ember 1985, the maximum number of c lub members was inc reased from 3,600 to 4,000. At the same time, the c onstitution of the c lub was amended so that potential members were required, when joining the c lub, to pay a fee, of whic h 15% c onstituted the entranc e fee and 85% c onstituted what was termed as an `initiation deposit`. 

The dispute between the respondent and the appellants c onc erns the initiation deposits. The respondent took the view that the initiation deposits are taxable as they are part of the c onsideration paid by members to join the c lub. On the other hand, the appellants asserted that while the entranc e fees ought to be regarded as taxable inc ome, the initiation deposits are interest-free loans from members of the c lub and are not subjec t to tax so long as they remain in the ac c ounts as a deferred liability. The appellants appealed to the Inc ome Tax Board of Review against the dec ision of the respondent but their appeal was unsuc c essful. The appellants then appealed against the dec ision of the Board. 

It would be fruitful at this junc ture to look at the arrangements c onc erning the payment and refund of the initiation deposits. If this is done, one c an fully understand why the respondent and the Inc ome Tax Board of Review took the view that the initiation deposits are not interest-free loans from members of the c lub. 

To begin with, an initiation deposit is refundable to a member of the c lub only if he has remained a member for 30 years. This, by itself, raises no eyebrows. What is worth noting is that no c laim for a refund of the initiation deposit c an be made by any person who wishes to remain a member of the c lub. This is bec ause a member who seeks a refund of the initiation deposit after he has been a 


member of the c lub for 30 years is required to terminate his membership. The appellants are thus requiring the member c onc erned to c hoose between c ontinued membership of the c lub or a refund of what the appellants themselves c ontend is an interest-free loan from the member to the c lub. 

Stringent c onditions are applic able to any c laim for a refund of initiation deposits. For a start, an initiation deposit is only refundable if a c laim is made within six months after the 30th year of membership. If suc h a c laim is not made within the said six months, the right to a refund of the initiation deposit is lost. Note must also be taken of the c lub`s rules relating to forfeiture of initiation deposits. These rules, whic h are, without more, c learly out of plac e in the c ontext of a lenderborrower situation, provide that a member`s initiation deposit is forfeited in the following c irc umstanc es: 

(a) When he or she bec omes of unsound mind. 

(b) When he or she is c onvic ted of an offenc e other than a traffic offenc e or is adjudged bankrupt or is subjec t to bankruptc y proc eedings. 

(c ) When he or she resigns from the c lub. 

(d) When he or she dies. 

(e) When there are moneys in arrears relating to the outstanding subsc ription or deposit monies. (The appellants have forfeited some initiation deposits on the ground that overdue ac c ounts had not been settled.) 

(f) When the c lub is dissolved. 

A member who leaves the c lub by selling and transferring his membership to another person is not entitled to a refund of the initiation deposit whic h he has paid. Instead, the initiation deposit remains in the hands of the c lub and may be refunded to the transferee member provided the new member has remained with the c lub for 30 years and meets the stringent c onditions laid down for the c laiming of initiation deposits. In short, the c lub`s liability to repay the initiation deposit paid by the member selling the membership is postponed to 30 years from the date of the transfer of membership in the c lub. If the appellants are right in c ontending that the initiation deposits are non-taxable interest-free loans, this means that where a membership has passed through innumerable hands, the appellants will retain the relevant initiation deposit indefinitely and need not pay tax on it until the initiation deposit has finally passed into their hands bec ause of a failure by the member c onc erned to c laim it within six months after reac hing the 30th year of membership or by virtue of the c lub`s forfeiture c lauses. 

**_The decision of the Income Tax Board of Review_** 

The Inc ome Tax Board of Review, whic h upheld the dec ision of the respondent, did not agree with the appellants that the initiation deposits paid to them by members of the c lub were in law interest-free loans whic h should not have been treated as inc ome ac c rued to the appellants. The Board pointed out that there are a number of indic ators whic h, when taken together, make it c lear that the initiation deposits are not interest-free loans to the c lub. The Board furnished six reasons for its dec ision. 

First, the Board noted that the initiation deposits were not desc ribed as loans in either the c lub`s c onstitution or in any of the forms exec uted by members for the purpose of joining the c lub. Had the initiation deposits been intended to be interest-free loans from the onset, there would have been some indic ation to this effec t in these doc uments. 


Sec ondly, the Board noted that the c lub`s right of forfeiture and the c irc umstanc es under whic h the initiation deposits c ould be forfeited by the c lub are features not c ommonly found in loan transac tions. 

Thirdly, the Board pointed out that the transfer fee c harged by the c lub on membership transfers was c omputed as a perc entage of the full admission c harge, inc lusive of the initiation deposit, and not on the entranc e fee alone. The Board noted that the appellants explained that this method of c alc ulating the transfer fee was employed as a matter of administrative c onvenienc e and was not evidenc e of the intention of the parties. However, the Board said that the c lub`s explanation, when viewed in c onjunc tion with the other fac ts, c ould not be ac c epted. The Board summed up the first three fac tors already disc ussed as follows: 

 When viewed individually and in isolation, the above facts are ambivalent and equivocal. But when they are viewed in combination, the clear inference must be that there had been no intention by either party to the transaction to create a debt, nor had the parties contemplated the creation of a debt. The totality of the transaction also militates against a finding that the initiation deposits are loans. The improbability of the members actually applying to the appellants for a refund must also be borne in mind. That would again indicate that the transaction was not a loan. 

Fourthly, the Board pointed out that the Inc ome Tax Ac t employs the test of ac c rual and noted that the initiation deposit is due and payable at the time of applic ation of membership bec ause r 15 of the c lub`s c onstitution requires the approved applic ation form for membership to be submitted together with, **_inter alia_** , the initiation deposit. As suc h, the Board ac c epted that the appellants earned the initiation deposit when membership in the c lub was granted to an applic ant. The fac t that the appellants may have to refund the initiation deposit at a future date does not, without more, show that the said deposit is not inc ome. The Board pointed out that there are many c ases whic h show that the possibility of a refund does not, by itself, prevent a payment from being taxed. 

Fifthly, the Board took the view that the initiation deposit sc heme may be c harac terised as a `c ontrac tual buy-bac k` sc heme. The Board pointed out that the refund of initiation deposits does not merely involve the payment of money by the appellants to members who satisfy the c onditions set out in r 20A of the c lub`s c onstitution. Those who c laim a refund of their initiation deposits are required to terminate their membership in the c lub. This is a very strong indic ation that the arrangement in question is a c ontrac tual buy-bac k of the membership in the c lub rather than an interest-free loan from members of the c lub. 

Sixthly, the Board said that c lub membership was more than a mere personal right to use c lub fac ilities. Club membership is a c hose in ac tion or some other form of intangible right if only bec ause it is transferable. The point whic h was made by the respondent was that if the initiation deposit was indeed a loan, one would have expec ted that upon the sale of the membership by a member, there would have been some doc uments evidenc ing the transfer or assignment of the debt from one c reditor to another. However, in this c ase, there was none. 

For the reasons stated above, the Inc ome Tax Board of Review dismissed the appellants` appeal. 

**_The appeal_** 


The grounds on whic h the appellants attac ked the dec ision of the Inc ome Tax Board of Review inc lude the following: 

 (a) The Board manifestly erred in its classification of the said initiation deposits as taxable income merely because such transactions were not described as loans either in the clubs constitution or the membership forms. 

 (b) The Board incorrectly made a finding without any basis, on the improbability of members actually applying for and obtaining refunds under the appellants membership. 

 (c) The Board erred in finding that the initiation deposits had come home to the appellants. 

 (d) The Board erred in classifying the transaction in question as a contractual buy-back scheme. 

 (e) The Board gave insufficient weight to the accounting treatment of the initiation deposits, which were classified in the appellants books as deferred liabilities. 

 (f) No deductible expenses are likely to be refunded by the respondents in the 30th year of accounting, and especially so if the initiation deposits are held to be taxable income accruing at the point of payment of membership fees. 

 (g) The Board failed to draw a material distinction between entrance fees, which constitute consideration, and initiation deposits, which are in fact loans from members. 

 (h) The Board failed to note that the initiation deposits constitute a mutuum (quasi-bailment). 

 (i) The Board failed to note that the appellants were giving effect to what the parties have contractually agreed upon in the club constitution. 

At the outset, it ought to be noted that it is often not easy for a tax payer to persuade the c ourt to overrule a dec ision of the Inc ome Tax Board of Review. In **Mount Elizabeth (Pte) Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax** [1986] SLR 421 , 429, Chan Sek Keong JC, as he then was, summed up the position in the following suc c inc t terms: 

 In the context of Lord Radcliffes speech in Edwards v Bairstow & Harrison [1955] 36 TC 207 and the Court of Appeals decision in CBH v Comptroller of Income Tax [1982] 1 MLJ 112 as to the test an appellate body must apply in hearing an appeal of this nature, the submissions of counsel for the applicant can be distilled and encapsulated into one contention, and that is, the Board erred in law in that no reasonable body of members constituting an Income Tax Review Board could have reached the findings reached by the Board in this instance. When the appellants appeal is reduced to this dimension, it becomes apparent that, in this appeal, the appellant has a heavy burden to discharge before achieving lift off. 


For the purpose of this appeal, the starting point must be s 10 of the Inc ome Tax Ac t (Cap 134, 1996 Ed), whic h provides as follows: 

 Income tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or rates specified hereinafter for each year of assessment upon the income of any person accruing in or derived from Singapore or received in Singapore from outside Singapore in respect of 

 (a) gains or profits from any trade, business, profession or vocation, for whatever period of time such trade, business, profession or vocation may have been carried on or exercised. 

Under s 10 of the Inc ome Tax Ac t, inc ome whic h ac c rues to the taxpayer is subjec t to tax. In this appeal, the main issue is whether or not the appellants are right in c ontending that the initiation deposits did not ac c rue to them in the year of payment bec ause they are interest-free loans from members of the c lub. As suc h, if the initiation deposits c annot be c harac terised as interest-free loans and if the question of quasi-bailment does not arise, the appeal must be dismissed. 

The main plank in the appellants` argument that the initiation deposits are non-taxable interest-free loans from the members of the c lub is that the said deposits may have to be refunded to members under c ertain c onditions after 30 years of membership of the c lub. If this is the only c onsideration, there might have been some merit in the appellants` argument that the initiation deposits c annot be regarded as inc ome whic h has ac c rued to them. However, the c onditions whic h must be c omplied with before a member is entitled to a refund of the initiation deposit and the varied c irc umstanc es under whic h the initiation deposit may be forfeited by the c lub totally remove the ground on whic h the appellants` argument stands. The appellants relied on, inter alia, **_Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation_** 14 ATD 98 to show that the Inc ome Tax Board of Review erred. This Australian c ase is irrelevant to the present c ase as it involved an advanc e payment of fees. In the present c ase, the appellants have ac c epted that the initiation deposit is not a payment in advanc e for food and beverage, subsc riptions or servic es. 

The appellants` c ounsel rightly pointed out that for the purpose of determining whether the initiation deposits are interest-free loans, the answer does not depend on a labelling exerc ise by the appellants. After all, in **IRC v Wesleyan and General Assurance Society** [1948] 1 All ER 555; 30 TC 11, Visc ount Simon, who pointed out that the name given to a transac tion by the parties c onc erned does not nec essarily dec ide the nature of the transac tion, added that the question always is what is the real c harac ter of the payment and not what the parties c all it. In this c ontext, the appellants have no basis for asserting that the Board erred by c lassifying the initiation deposits as taxable inc ome merely bec ause suc h transac tions were not desc ribed as `loans` either in the appellants` c onstitution or the membership forms. Admittedly, the Board stated that had the initiation deposits been intended to be loans from the onset, there would have been indic ations to this effec t in the c onstitution or in the forms exec uted by persons applying to join the c lub. However, the Board did not view this lac k of doc umentation in isolation from other fac ts. Indeed, it made it c lear that when the lac k of doc umentation is viewed in c ombination with other fac tors, `the c lear inferenc e must be that there had been no intention by either party to the transac tion to c reate a debt`. For good measure, the Board opined that the totality of the transac tion also militates against a finding that the initiation deposits are loans. 


While on the subjec t of labels, it should also be noted that the fac t that the appellants` ac c ountants have c lassified the initiation deposits as `deferred liabilities` c annot, without more, be c onc lusive of the matter for as Lord Denning MR pointed out in **Heather (Inspector of Taxes) v PE Consulting Group Ltd** [1973] Ch 189, 217; [1973] 1 All ER 8, 13, while the c ourts have always been assisted greatly by the evidenc e of ac c ountants and their evidenc e should be given due weight, the c ourts have never regarded themselves as being bound by it. Indeed, his Lordship stressed that it would be wrong for the c ourts to regard themselves as being bound by ac c ounting prac tic es. 

The c onc ept of a `loan` is eluc idated in **_Chitty on Contracts_** (28th Ed), Vol 2, at p 700, in the following terms: 

 A contract of loan of money is a contract whereby one person lends or agrees to lend a sum of money to another, in consideration of a promise express or implied to repay that sum on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, or conditionally upon an event which is bound to happen, with or without interest. 

As it is elementary that a loan is repayable to the lender in due c ourse, the c lub`s stringent limitations on the right of members to c laim a refund of their initiation deposits and the c lub`s rules on forfeiture of initiation deposits make it impossible for the appellants to c ontend that the initiation deposits are interest-free loans from the members of the c lub. The rule that a member`s initiation deposit is forfeited if he or she c ommits an offenc e other than a traffic offenc e, or is in arrears in his or her dues, or is bankrupt, c learly points to the initiation deposit being not an interest-free loan. Thus, the Inc ome Tax Board of Review rightly said as follows: 

 It would seem to be a highly unusual loan if the loan could be forfeited by the debtor upon the creditors resignation from a certain organisation (r 20), or if the creditor was to become of unsound mind, adjudicated bankrupt, subjected to winding up proceedings or convicted of an offence other than a traffic offence (r 21). Indeed, if the initiation deposit had truly been intended to be a loan, then it would seem likely that a member would like to have his money back in case of a bankruptcy. Similarly, if a member is found to be of unsound mind, then surely his family members would also like to recover the money paid to the Appellants. 

I endorse the Board`s view. There is no reason why a borrower should, without more, be entitled to profit when the lender has, for instanc e, been found guilty of assaulting another person or for forging another person`s signature. As for the c lub`s c laim that it is entitled to forfeit the initiation deposit of a bankrupt member, a question arises as to whether the c lub is entitled to put itself ahead of the bankrupt member`s c reditors if the said deposit is in fac t an interest-free loan from the said member to the c lub. 

The fac t that a member of the c lub has to resign in order to get his initiation deposit bac k also militates against the initiation deposit being an interest-free loan. A member who lends his assoc iation money does not, in the ordinary c ourse of events, have to leave the assoc iation in order to c laim bac k his own money without interest at an agreed date in the future. The Inc ome Tax Board of Review took note of this and said as follows: 

 The refund of the initiation deposit does not merely involve the payment of 


 money by the appellants to a member who satisfies the conditions set out in r 20A, but also requires the member to terminate his membership in the club. The indication is, therefore, very strong that the arrangement is not a loan but a contractual buy-back of the membership in the club, and we do find that that is the legal nature of the entire arrangement between the appellants and members in the club involving the payment and refund of initiation deposits. 

The Board is c ertainly entitled to view the situation as a `c ontrac tual buy-bac k` sc heme and not the refunding of interest-free loans. The appellants asserted that as the c ontrac ting parties are at liberty to determine the terms of their agreement, the c ondition relating to termination of membership c annot be held against them. This c annot be c ountenanc ed. When referring to this term as well to as the forfeiture c lauses, the Inc ome Tax Board of Review pointed out as follows: 

 It is of course true that the contractual terms pertaining to the initiation deposits are open to the parties, viz the club and its members to decide. But in the absence of express evidence of the parties intentions at the time of the contract, their intentions must be inferred. We find that the unusual nature of the forfeiture clauses, although not decisive in itself, would nonetheless be inconsistent with an inference of a loan. 

For a better perspec tive of what may properly be regarded as loans to a c lub, one may c onsider the arrangements for loans from members of the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National Golf and Country Club. The appellants tried to put themselves in the same position as these c lubs but it is evident that the shoes did not fit. To begin with, the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National Golf and Country Club, unlike the appellants, made it absolutely c lear from the very start that they were taking loans from their members. Unlike the appellants` c lub, whic h sits on freehold land, the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National and Golf Club sit on land whic h is leased to them for a short period. Thus, the Raffles Marina and Laguna National and Golf Club arranged for the loans from their members to be repayable on a fixed date. A trust deed was made between these two c lubs and a trustee c orporation, namely, the British & Malayan Trustees Ltd, whic h agreed to ac t for the benefit of the holders of unsec ured notes issued with respec t to the loans. Rules 2.3 and 3.3 of the trust deed provide that the c orporate and non-c orporate sec ured notes shall, as between the holders thereof, rank pari passu and rateably without disc rimination or preferenc e as an unsec ured obligation of the c ompany ranking, subjec t to suc h exc eptions as may from time to time exist under applic able law, pari passu with all other present and future unsec ured obligations other than subordinated obligations, if any, of the c ompany. Furthermore, the trust deed c ontains suffic iently stringent safeguards to ensure that the members are repaid their loans. Clause 4.1 of the trust deed provides as follows: 

 The Company hereby covenants with the Trustee that as and when the [unsecured notes] or any part thereof become due to be redeemed in accordance with the provisions of these presents the Company will unconditionally pay to the Trustee at the registered office of the Trustee ... the principal amount of the [unsecured notes] or any part thereof which is then due to be redeemed in accordance with the provisions of these presents. 

Another important differenc e between the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National Golf Club loans and the initiation deposits in this c ase is that while the appellants` members are required to rec laim their initiation deposits within six months after the 30th year of membership, the members of the Raffles Marina and Laguna National and Golf Club have a period of six years after the date fixed for the refund 


of the loans to c laim their money. It is only after the said six years that the question of forfeiture of money loaned arises. Before any suc h forfeiture, the trustees may require stringent efforts to loc ate the members. Clause 17.1 of the trust deed provides as follows: 

 ... Provided that the Trustee before being required to make any such repayment to the Company may at the expense of the Company cause to be published prior to the date of such repayment at least twice and at intervals of not less than twenty-one (21) days in The Straits Times in Singapore ... a notice that such moneys remain unclaimed and that after the date stated therein (not being less than twenty-one (21) days after the date of the second such notice) any unclaimed balance of the said moneys then remaining shall be returned to the Company. 

Looking at the thorough way in whic h the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National and Golf Club handled the situation, inc luding the setting up of trust deeds, the appointment of trustees and the c lear ac knowledgement from the very start that they borrowed money from their members, it is not surprising that the Comptroller of Inc ome Tax was persuaded that the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National and Golf Club took loans from their members. The appellants are of c ourse not required to follow every step taken by the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National Golf and Country Club in order to prove that the initiation deposits c ollec ted by them are interest-free loans from their members. However, by not following the Raffles Marina and the Laguna National Golf and Country Club in making it so c lear that loans are being sought from their members and by having unusual c lauses relating to forfeiture of the initiation deposits, the appellants made it muc h easier for the Inc ome Tax Board of Review to c onc lude that the initiation deposits are not interest-free loans from the members of the c lub. 

I now turn to the appellants` c ontention that they are not entitled to a tax deduc tion for any deposit refunded to a member who has made a c laim within the presc ribed period after the 30th year of membership. The Inc ome Tax Board of Review, whic h pointed out that whether or not the respondent has the power to grant tax deduc tions to the appellants for refunds of initiation deposits is not an issue whic h has to be dec ided in this c ase, nonetheless added that s 14(1) of the Inc ome Tax Ac t does not prec lude the deduc tion of expenses inc urred in a partic ular year of assessment with respec t to inc ome produc ed during a prior period of assessment. In any c ase, c ounsel for the respondent aptly noted that it is strange that the appellants should insist that a refund of an initiation deposit is not deduc tible when the respondent, the national tax authority, has stated time and again that a deduc tion will be allowed for the refund of initiation deposits with respec t to the inc ome generated in the year the initiation deposits are refunded. 

The appellants` attempt to avoid payment of tax by c lassifying an initiation deposit as a mutuum will next be c onsidered. A mutuum is a loan of something whic h is not to be returned in spec ie. Instead, the parties ac c ept that the thing borrowed is to be replac ed by something similar and equivalent. In this c ase, there is a real likelihood that the initiation deposits may not be refunded at all, either bec ause they have been forfeited or a c laim for its return has not been be made within six months after the 30th year of membership. As suc h, the question of a mutuum does not arise. In any c ase, the full ramific ations of c lassifying a transac tion as a `mutuum` have not been worked out by the c ourts and this is c ertainly not an appropriate c ase for the development of the law with respec t to a mutuum. 

Before agreeing with the respondent that the initiation deposits are taxable when rec eived, the Inc ome Tax Board of Review paid metic ulous attention to the c lub`s c onstitution, applic ation forms, 


minutes of meetings and other doc uments brought to its notic e and c onc luded that none of them disc losed any hint of a loan. The Board c onsidered the forfeiture c lauses and c ould not rec onc ile these provisions with the normal inc idents of a debtor-lender relationship. The Board also took note of the requirement that a member had to resign in order to c laim a refund of his or her initiation deposit. I am satisfied that on the fac ts, the Board`s findings were not erroneous in law or based on insuffic ient evidenc e. As suc h, the findings of the Board should not be disturbed. In view of this, the appellants` appeal against the dec ision of the Inc ome Tax Board of Review was dismissed with c osts. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal dismissed.
