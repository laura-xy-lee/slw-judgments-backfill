: **_Introduction_** 

This is an unc ommon c ase of c ollision at sea. It is unusual bec ause it was not a c ollision between two ships. The damage was done to seismic c ables by the defendants` ship Tai He. The c ables were extended from the stern of the plaintiffs` ship Nordic Explorer. It happened in the afternoon of 18 September 1998 at about 1600 hours. The plaintiffs, as owners of the c ables, c laim damages from the owners of the Chinese ship Teng He whic h was at the relevant time in the same ownership as the Tai He. 

The weather at the time, ac c ording to an admission in the preliminary ac t of the defendants, was `c loudy and hazy. Visibility was less than 1 mile due to fog.` The poor visibility is the most signific ant feature of this c ase. 

The Nordic Explorer was 81.8m in length, 14.5m in breadth. She measured 3,861 tonnes gross register. She was c ustom-built to c arry out seismic exploration for undersea oil. At the time of the time of the inc ident in all seven seismic streamer c ables of 3.6 kilometres eac h were c onnec ted to her. The full length of the c ables was in exc ess of 4 kilometres. At the relevant time the full length had not been run out. At the far end of eac h c able, a tail buoy was attac hed to eac h c able. Eac h buoy was 3 metres in length, 0.8m in breadth and weighed 350 kg. To the human eyes the buoys were not anything resembling fishing vessels. One would expec t the buoys to display the bright end of VIBGYOR that is yellow, orange or red. In this c ase they were painted bright yellow. 

At the relevant time the seismic operations were being c arried out in Bo Hai Gulf, China. 

**_Plaintiffs` pleaded case_** 

The plaintiffs` c ase stated in their preliminary ac t was as follows. 


At all material times, the plaintiffs were c arrying out seismographic researc h ac tivities within Bo Hai Gulf, People`s Republic of China. On 18 September 1998, the Nordic Explorer was towing the seven seismic streamer c ables and making way at about 4 to 4.5 knots on the true c ourse of 132 degrees at latitude 38 degrees 34.15 minutes North and longitude 120 degrees 21.61 minutes East. Eac h tail buoy was fitted with a radar reflec tor and a GPS beac on showing the position of the tail buoys. 

In ac c ordanc e with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, the Nordic Explorer exhed three all-round lights in a vertic al line in a red-white-red order, together with three shapes of ball-diamond-ball in a vertic al line, as presc ribed by r 27(b) for vessels restric ted in their ability to manoeuvre. Additionally, the Nordic Explorer also exec uted the sound signal presc ribed in r 35(c ) of a prolonged blast followed by two short blasts of the ship`s horn. This was to indic ate that she was towing another vessel in restric ted visibility. 

In addition, those on board the Nordic Explorer made c ontinuous radio broadc asts via VHF International Safety Calling Frequenc y Channel 16 (`VHF Channel 16`) of the position and operations of the Nordic Explorer every half hourly in the English language, followed by a Chinese translation as follows: 

 Securite Securite Securite. This is survey vessel Nordic Explorer, at position xx, yy, speed & heading. We are towing seven submerged high voltage steel cables. All shipping is advised to give Nordic Explorer minimum 3NM clearance for safety reasons. 

The plaintiffs also deployed six c haseboats to protec t and c hase away any on-c oming vessels in the vic inity of the Nordic Explorer and the seismic streamer c ables towed by her. 

The Tai He was a c ontainer ship built in 1989. At all material times, the Tai He was making a c ourse of about 100 degrees from Xingang to Dalian at about 14 to 15 knots. 

At approximately 1535 hours, the Tai He was c hec ked as a target on the radar of c haseboat No 201 at a distanc e of about 3 nautic al miles. At the given c ourse, a c ollision by Tai He with the seismic streamer c ables towed by the Nordic Explorer was imminent and the c haseboat No 201 proc eeded immediately at full speed to the midship of the Tai He to warn her of the presenc e and operations of Nordic Explorer. The c rew of c haseboat No 201 fired 5 red flares to attrac t the attention of the c rew on board the Tai He and using a loud speaker, also warned the Tai He of the seismic streamer c ables ahead and advised the Tai He to c hange her c ourse immediately to 180 degrees starboard. Chaseboat No 201 also sounded several long blasts of the ship`s whistle. The c rew on board c haseboat No 201 made repeated attempts to make c ontac t with Tai He via VHF Channel 16 to warn them of the imminent c ollision. However, the c rew on board Tai He failed to respond. 

At about the same time, the First Offic er on board Nordic Explorer fired several green flares from the mid-ship sec tion of Nordic Explorer into the air for a duration of 5 minutes to warn Tai He of the danger ahead. Eac h flare burned in the sky for approximately 40 sec onds before fading. 

In spite of the above attempts the c rew on board the Tai He refused and/or neglec ted and/or failed to respond. 

Instead the Tai He kept her c ourse towards the starboard quarter of the Nordic Explorer and at approximately 1606 hours ship`s time, steamed ac ross and severed all seven seismic streamer c ables towed by the Nordic Explorer. By ignoring and failing to respond to the repeated warnings given by 


the plaintiffs, the defendants, their servants and/or their agents were negligent in their navigation and/or management of the Tai He. 

The plaintiffs gave the following partic ulars of negligenc e: 

(i) failed to keep a proper lookout; 

(ii) failed to make proper and timely use of their radar, and/or failed to observe and/or ac t upon its indic ations in due time and/or with proper or seamanlike skill and c are or at all; 

(iii) failed to heed the repeated warnings broadc asted over the VHF of the operations and position of Nordic Explorer and/or taking any steps or measures to prevent and/or avoid Nordic Explorer. 

(iv) failed to keep c lear of Nordic Explorer; 

(v) failed to apprec iate the imminenc e of a c ollision and/or heed the repeated warnings broadc asted over the VHF c hannel 16 of the imminenc e of a c ollision and/or ac ting upon suc h indic ations so as to prevent and/or avoid a c ollision. 

(vi) failed to notic e the red and green flares fired in its direc tion to warn the Tai He of the presenc e of the Nordic Explorer and the seismic streamer c ables; 

(vii) proc eeded at an exc essive speed; 

(viii) failed to ease, stop or reverse their engines in due time or at all; 

(ix) failed to alter c ourse to avoid a c ollision with the plaintiffs` seismic streamer c ables; and/or 

(x) failed to c omply with rr 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 34 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 as amended. 

**_The defendants` pleaded case_** 

The Tai He`s pleaded c ase was as follows. There was no c ollision between the Tai He and the Nordic Explorer and/or her seismic c ables as alleged by the plaintiffs or at all. Ac c ordingly the plaintiffs had no c ause of ac tion against the defendants. 

The defendants had no knowledge of the alleged c ontac t between their vessel the Tai He and the seismic c ables of the Nordic Explorer. Further or in the alternative, if there was suc h c ontac t as alleged or at all, whic h was denied, the plaintiffs were nevertheless solely to be blamed for the c ontac t. 

The defendants made the following c ounter-c harges against the plaintiffs: 

(a) At all material times, the plaintiffs and/or their servants or agents failed to issue and/or c ause to be issued any or adequate navigational warnings to alert the traffic in the vic inity of the Bo Hai Gulf inc luding the Tai He that the Nordic Explorer was c arrying out seismographic researc h ac tivities within Penglai-14 c onc ession in the Bo Hai Gulf, China. 

(b) The plaintiffs and/or their servants or agents knew or ought to have known that the navigational warnings in respec t of their seismographic ac tivities were not being reported in the Notic es to 


Mariners or via Navtext from the time the Nordic Explorer c ommenc ed their seismographic ac tivities on or about 30 July 1998 to the time of the alleged inc ident on 18 September 1998. 

(c ) The Nordic Explorer failed to take any or suffic ient steps to c ause her seismic c ables to be submerged to suc h a depth and/or to remain at suc h a depth so as to avert any possible c ontac t with onc oming vessels inc luding but not limited to the Tai He. 

(d) The Nordic Explorer having c aused her seismic c ables to be submerged to a depth of 17 metres at 1538 hours were negligent in c ausing the said seismic c ables to return to the operating depth of 7 metres at 1556 hours (just a few minutes before the alleged c ontac t) when they were aware or ought to have been aware of the presenc e of onc oming vessels inc luding but not limited to the Tai He. 

(e) Those on board the Nordic Explorer failed to keep any or proper lookout and/or failed to make proper use of their radar to apprec iate and/or determine in proper time the presenc e of the Tai He and that those on board the Tai He was navigating in suc h a manner as to indic ate that they were unaware that the Nordic Explorer was towing seven seismic c ables of 3,600 metres in length and 600 metres in breadth. 

(f) Those on board the Nordic Explorer failed to effec tively c o-ordinate and/or deploy the six c haseboats in suc h a manner whic h would have prevented the Tai He from entering the area where the seismographic ac tivities were being c arried out. 

(g) The Tai He was at all material times proc eeding on the eastbound lane of the Traffic Separation Sc heme for transportation vessels on the Northern Coastal Waters as presc ribed by the Chinese Ministry of Transport. The Nordic Explorer was at all material times c utting ac ross the Traffic Separation Sc heme at a fine angle and in so doing failed to keep c lear of the Tai He whic h was proc eeding in the c orrec t eastbound lane. 

**_The defendants` navigation_** 

The defendants made the following admissions in their preliminary ac t: At about 1545 hours the Tai He was steering a c ourse of 94[ordm ] G at a speed of about 17.5 knots when a c luster of ec hoes were observed. The distanc e of the targets was 5 to 6 miles bearing less than 1 point on the port bow. None of the plaintiffs` vessels was visually sighted at that time. Further, in relation to the plaintiffs` vessels, the Tai He altered c ourse to 117[ordm ] G. At about 1605 hours the Tai He altered c ourse by 5[ordm ] to port to return to the c ourse of 094[ordm ] G. However, before her heading had reverted to 094[ordm ] G the Tai He c hanged c ourse by 15[ordm ] to starboard at about 1607 hours to bring her c ourse to 113[ordm ] G. After passing and c learing all the vessels in the c luster at about 1612 hours, the Tai He resumed c ourse to 094[ordm ] G. 

The Chief Offic er of the Tai He, the navigating offic er at the relevant time in his evidenc e gave these additional partic ulars. At about 1602 hours he observed on the ARPA that the Tai He passed a small target on the port side at a distanc e of 1 to 1.5 miles. This small target was proc eeding in the opposite direc tion at a very slow speed. It was not possible to observe the vessel visually. At about 1605 hours, he observed again on the ARPA that the Tai He had passed a c luster of targets on his port side at a passing distanc e of less than 1 mile. Owing to poor visibility it was not possible to asc ertain the nature of the targets. As he was able to pass the targets by a safe distanc e, it was not nec essary to determine what type of boats they were although he suspec ted that they were fishing boats. 


In c ourt the Chief Offic er was given a paper showing the ac tual c ourse traversed by the Tai He ac c ording to her c ourse rec order from 1545 to 1608. On that paper he marked the c luster of vessels at 1555, 1602 and 1605. He also marked the position and direc tion of another vessel (`the big white vessel`) at 1602 and 1605. This was marked as exh P4. It is to be noted that ac c ording to this paper the distanc e between the c luster and the Tai He at 1602 was 8 c ables. At 1605 the distanc e was 7 c ables. That was the c losest distanc e. Ac c ording to his marking the distanc e c overed by the c luster between 1555 and 1602 (7 mins) was about 3 c ables. From 1602 to 1603 (3 mins) the c luster travelled a distanc e of about 7 c ables. As shown in exh P4 the `big white vessel` passed ahead of the c luster from East to West. 

**_Charges and counter charges_** 

I must now relate an event of 25 September 1998, that is seven days after the c ollision. On the day of c ollision the plaintiffs were unable to interc ept and halt the Tai He. After the c ables were severed the plaintiffs did some detec tive work and identified the Tai He as the ship whic h damaged the c ables. Consequently one Mr AJ Cunningham boarded the Tai He on behalf of the plaintiffs and met the Master of the Tai He at the Port of Kobe. Mr Cunningham was ac c ompanied by one Mr Megumi Fujisawa, who was the plaintiffs` shipping agent in Japan. The Master of the Tai He was asked whether he was aware that his ship c rossed and severed the seven seismic c ables. The Master c alled his Offic ers. Mr Cunningham gave him a c opy of a segment of the admiralty c hart depic ting the Nordic Explorer and the satellite boats protec ting the operations. Ac c ording to Mr Cunningham the Master on seeing the c hart stated that `he would never take his ship through suc h a c ongested area`. The Master was of c ourse referring to the c ommunity of the plaintiffs` c hase boats and the buoys. Ac c ording to Mr Cunningham, the offic er on seeing his illustration stated that ` **_whilst he heard urgent navigation warnings being issued via VHF radio_** , ... he was nowhere near the Nordic Explorer or her equipment.` 

It would be helpful to set out in full the report prepared by Mr Cunningham on the same day: 

 At 10.30am Friday 25 September the author of this memo boarded M/V Tai He in order to confront the Captain of the vessel regarding the streamer incident that is the basis of PGS incident report Incident Investigation M/V Nordic Explorer 18.9.98. 

 The visit was brief in order that the Captain could manage his duties as required to conduct his port call in Kobe according to the vessels planned schedule. 

 Mr Megumi Fujisawa of Mitsubishi Logistics, who acts as PGS freight and shipping agent in Japan, accompanied the author during this visit to the M/V Tai He. 

 The aforesaid made the following statement: 

 Captain, are you aware that at 1606 hrs Local Tme 18 September 1998 that your vessel crossed and severed 7 seismic cables belonging to our Survey Vessel M/V Nordic Explorer whilst you were transiting between Xingang and Dalian. The position of the incident was approximately 38 deg 35 min N 120 deg 20 min E. 

 At this point the Captain called the Officer who was on watch at the time. The Officer brought with him the chart used for the purpose of navigation during 


 that leg of their voyage. 

 The author presented a copy of a chart depicting the Nordic Explorer and the Chase/Guard boat protecting the operation. The Captain compared his chart with ours and both parties agreed that the Nordic Explorer and the M/V Tai He were within close proximity at that place, at that time and on that day. Although the Captains standpoint at that time was not to confirm that his vessel had been the ship that caused the damage. However it was evident to all parties present that we were less than a few miles apart at 1600 hrs on that same day. 

 The Captain stated that his 16:00 hrs position was approximately 38 deg 36. min N 120 deg 18 min E. Whereas our 16:06 position where the cables were cut was approximately 38 deg 35 min N 120 deg 20 min E. 

 The Officer who was on watch then stated that whilst  he heard urgent Navigation Warnings being issued via VHF radio, that he was nowhere near the Nordic Explorer or her equipment . 

 The Captain, on seeing the authors chart stated that he  would never take his ship through such a congested area  (referring of course to our community of chase boats). 

 The PGS agent observed and listened to the reactions of all crew present at the meeting and clearly heard the statements made by the Captain. 

Those on board the Tai He prepared their own report in Chinese. The following is the translation of the report. 

 M/V Tai He V157E moored at Kobe, Japan on 25 September 1998 at 0915. Two persons came onto the vessel. They said they were from PGS Company (see attached photocopies of their name cards) and asked for the Captain. They made representations to the Captain and said: on 18 September at 1605L, Tai He, in the midst of the XIN-DAL voyage, in the Bo Hai Gulf crossed astern of the scientific seismic exploration vessel Nordic Explorer and cut 7 cables that were towed by the vessel. Each cable was 3,500 m long, and about 1,000 m was cut. The seismic exploration vessel was 3,500 GT and there were six small Chinese boats protecting the seismic vessel. The two persons said that the seismic exploration vessel was on a course of 132[ordm ], speed was 5 knots. Visibility was about 1 mile. The seismic exploration vessel and the surrounding small boats discovered Tai He and had tried by VHF to call Tai He and fired flares. However, Tai He did not take avoidance action and caused the severance of the cables. 

 I immediately called the second officer Mei Ya Dong, Chief Officer Qu Jian Ping, assistant navigator Miao Jianquing in order to understand the situation. All 3 of them said: the visibility at the time was 4-5 miles, Tai He was on a course of 094[ordm ], speed 17.5 knots. 

 The second officer said: At a distance of about 6 miles, he observed on the radar the echo of a big vessel (port side about 8[ordm ]) and the echoes of 


 some small boats (port side about 5[ordm ]). At a distance of about 4-5 miles, he used the binoculars and observed the big vessel and the small vessel (small dark shadows). The big vessel was behind the small boats (northwest). At 1555L, the second officer handed over the watch to the Chief Officer, and said that there was a big vessel and some small boats on the port side at a distance of 3 to 4 miles. The Chief Officer observed the radar, and then observed with a pair of binoculars. At 1554L, the Chief Officer ordered starboard 15 to the helmsman in order to give way on the right. At about 1606L, the vessel gave way to the big and small vessels. The CPA of the big vessel was more than 1 nautical mile and the CPA of the small vessel was about 0.8 nautical mile. No call was heard on the VHF and no signal flare was seen. 

 The Chief Officer and the assistant navigator said: at 1552L, the echo of a big vessel and some boats were seen on the radar. Immediately after that they used the binoculars and observed the vessels. The big vessel (white colour) was behind all the boats (orange colour), and it was not that the six boats surrounded the big vessel, as shown in the other partys map. At 1555L, the Chief Officer order starboard 15[ordm ] to the helmsman until the ships heading was 117[ordm ], and then he ordered to steady the heading, and gave way to all the vessels on the port side of the Tai He. The CPA of the big vessel was at least 1 nautical mile, and the CPA of the small boats was at least 0. mile. No call was heard and no signal was seen. At 1606L, he ordered to go back to the original course. At 1608L, in order to give way to a crossing vessel which was 45[ordm ] on the port side 2 miles away and proceeding in a southwesterly direction. Tai He again altered course to starboard until GC113[ordm ]. When there was no danger of collision, Tai He returned to the original course of 094[ordm ]. 

 We are of the view that the map of the other party was forged, and it was a sheer slanderous accusation. All their vessel and boats passed and was passed clear on the port side of Tai He Our vessel was moored again at a Chinese port. Why didnt they come to look for us there? 

 The three navigators and the AB on duty all guarantee with their moral integrity that Tai He gave way to their investigation vessel and the boats on the left, there was no contact at all, and the CPA was more than 0.5 miles. 

I hasten to add that all these matters by themselves are not helpful in dec iding the issue of liability. They, however, show that the rec ollec tion of the offic er of the Tai He one week after the inc ident was very different from their pleaded c ase and the subsequent evidenc e of the Chief. They demonstrated that the Chief Offic er of the Tai He did not know what was happening and his propensity to fabric ate in order to exc ulpate himself. 

An objec tive analysis of all the evidenc e shows that the Chief Offic er was not aware of the presenc e of the tail buoys in the vic inity. It is now nec essary to look again at exh P4. The position of the `small boats orange` (in fac t they were bright yellow) as marked by the Chief Offic er of the Tai He in relation to his own vessel at 1602 hours measures a distanc e of one mile. At this distanc e he c ould not see the buoys bec ause visibility was poor due to fog. He has already said that `owing to poor visibility it was not possible to asc ertain the nature of the targets`. How then does he know that they were small orange boats. The situation at 1605 hours as illustrated by him would not have been any better. The next paragraph will show that this was a c ontrived version. 


It is now nec essary to look at exh P3 whic h was prepared by experts on my direc tion. It is to be observed at 1604 hours the Tai He is ac tually 3 c ables distant from the nearest buoy. From 1601 hours the Tai He was on a c onverging c ourse with the buoys. This was a mindless thing and no one aware of the moving buoys would do suc h a thing. The Chief Offic er said that he assumed that they were fishing vessels. Fishing vessels are not small orange boats. Further, radar reflec tors of the buoys would have ec hoed suc h strong images that they c annot be mistaken for fishing vessels. This leads me to c onc lude that the Chief Offic er of the Tai He at no time was aware of the presenc e of buoys as suc h or as fishing vessels. He was merely navigating in response to the `big white vessel` as he visually observed her based on the estimate of a visibility of 4 to 5 miles mentioned in the report of 25 September 1998. That is the only rational and probable explanation for the manner of his navigation at 1555 hours he alters c ourse to starboard and onc e he gains a safe distanc e from the `big white vessel` he altered c ourse to resume his original direc tion. That vessel (a Korean ship) was muc h farther away from the Tai He at that time. He would not have done so had he known that c ertain objec ts were on a c onverging c ourse. 

**_Preliminary points of procedure_** 

It is now nec essary to make c ertain observations on the rules of pleadings. The normal rules relating to pleadings as stipulated in O 18 of the Rules of Court do not apply to c ases of c ollisions at sea between ships. In their stead the parties file doc uments c alled Preliminary Ac ts in ac c ordanc e with O 70 r 17 of the Rules of Court. Preliminary ac ts take the plac e of pleadings. 

The preliminary ac t c onsist of two parts. In the first part, the party sets out by way of answers standard but important information as stipulated in O 70 r 17(2) Part One of the Rules of Court. In Part Two, the party sets out any additional fac ts he relies on and `all allegations of negligenc e or other fault whic h the party filing the preliminary ac t makes`. One party does not sight the preliminary ac t of the other before he files his own preliminary ac t. Order 70 r 17 requires eac h preliminary ac t to be sealed by the c ourt. 

The preliminary ac ts serve three essential func tions: First, they forc e the parties to state their version of the fac ts while they are fresh in their rec ollec tion; sec ondly, they forc e the parties to `plead blind` so as to `prevent them from shaping their c ase to meet the fac ts put forward by the other party`; thirdly, `statements in a preliminary ac t are admissions of fac t, binding the party making them as strongly as any admission c an.` See **_The Admiralty Practice_** by Kenneth C Mc Guffie para 673, **_The Frankland_** (1872) LR 3 A&E 511, **The Vortigern** [1859] Sw 518, **The Lady Belle** [1933] P 275[1933] 46 Lloyd LR 342. 

In c ollision c ases, more important than the preliminary ac ts are c ontemporaneous doc umentary evidenc e like the c ourse rec order, the time log, the log books. Advanc es in tec hnology enable the minutely detailed rec ording and reproduc tion of non-human events relating to c ollision. These doc uments fac ilitate an easy and ac c urate investigation of c ollisions. Further, these doc uments make it impossible for witnesses to fabric ate or tailor their evidenc e to present a false c ase. In determining the issues before me I shall plac e great relianc e on these doc uments and exh P3 whic h was prepared on the basis of information obtained from these doc uments. 

Now I c ome to the most important prac tic e of the admiralty c ourt in c ollision c ases. Although the c ontents of a preliminary ac t as admissions are binding on the party filing it, the c ourt is not nec essarily bound by them. The c ourt must always asc ertain the truth and ac t on it. This is the first philosophy of judic ial proc ess. The c ourt c annot set its fac e against truth when it stares in front. The words of Lord Normand in **The Geo W McKnight** [1947] 80 Lloyd LR 419 at 423 eloquently express the 


prac tic e of the c ourt: `The c ourt is not bound by the pleadings of parties and must proc eed upon the evidenc e whic h it deems to be most ac c urate and trustworthy.` `Pleadings` here inc lude preliminary ac ts. 

Thus in **The Lady Belle** [1933] P 275[1933] 46 Lloyd LR 342 the plaintiffs c alled no evidenc e and merely relied on the preliminary ac t of the defendants and their log books. The defendants submitted that they had no c ase to answer. The c ourt held that their preliminary ac t was evidenc e and in any event their logs c onstituted indisputable evidenc e. Laugton J said that the preliminary ac ts `have the highest evidential value, are admissions and c an be rightly used by the other side as admissions against the parties making them. The point was not perhaps of very great importanc e, bec ause the same admissions and in the logs, and no one disputes for a moment that the logs are evidenc e.` Again in T **_he Geo W McKnigh_** t the c ourt ignored the c ontents of a preliminary ac t and preferred to ac t on a letter written by the ship`s master to her owners bec ause `there was no evidenc e more ac c urate and trustworthy than that letter`. 

**_Some uncontroverted facts_** 

It is appropriate now to rec ord the following matters: 

(i) After the c ables were severed, the plaintiffs retrieved the buoy-end of the severed c ables. Measurement of the c ut-off portion of the c ables was taken. This gives the distanc e of the Tai He from eac h of the tail buoy when the c able was severed. This also gives the angle at whic h the Tai He slit through the water in relation to the line formed by the seven buoys. They did not form a c luster as alleged by the Chief Offic er of the Tai He. This gives a distanc e of 4 c ables from the first tail buoy and a distanc e of 8 c ables from the last tail buoy. 

(ii) The GPS rec order of the Nordic Explorer rec orded its positions at the relevant times. From this information the speed and c ourse of the Nordic Explorer and the buoys c an be ac c urately deduc ted. 

(iii) From the c ourse rec order of the Tai He, the speed and c ourse trac ed by it c an be ac c urately asc ertained. 

Next, unc ontroverted evidenc e from the plaintiffs established that there was a Korean vessel whic h approac hed the Nordic Explorers` c ommunity of vessels from her port side. The plaintiffs managed to divert that vessel. That vessel first altered c ourse to starboard and then to port and passed astern of the 7 tail buoys. As a prec autionary mean the streamer c ables were dived to a depth of 17 metres. After the Korean vessel was no longer a threat to the c ables and the buoys, the Nordic Explorer raised the c ables. This was shortly before the Tai He slit through the water in front of the 7 buoys. 

As stated earlier, on my direc tion the experts produc ed a vivid illustration of the movements of the two princ ipal vessels and the buoys; see exh P3. This greatly fac ilitated the asc ertainment of the true pic ture of what happened. It gave a bird`s-eye view of what happened. 

**_A major concession by the defendants_** 

By all ac c ounts the Tai He passed in front of the tail buoys. Ac c ording to the Chief Offic er of the Tai He, there was a distanc e of some eight c ables, that is c lose to one mile between the buoys and the Tai He. Given the length of the c ables (that is 3.6 km), the Tai He by her own admission must have severed the c ables unless the c ables were sunk well below the draft of the Tai He. The c ables were 


not so sunk. It is therefore an inevitable c onc lusion that the Tai He severed the c ables. 

In view of the above the defendants, at the eleventh hour, c ontroverting their own voc iferous assertion that they passed the c ables and the survey vessel without c ontac t c onc eded that the Tai He severed the c ables. That c onc ession by itself does not c ondemn the defendants sinc e the c ables being submerged were not visible to the human eye. I must therefore c onsider other evidenc e before me and derive my dec ision on liability. In order to do that I must set out c ertain rules of safe navigation whic h must be internalized by every c ompetent navigator. 

**_Rules of caution_** 

At the time in question, the visibility was extremely restric ted even though the sun had not set. There was a fog. Visibility was less than one mile. Small objec ts, tow lines and lights in partic ular in suc h c ondition would be prac tic ally inc onspic uous. In other words vessels would not be visually in sight of one another. In suc h c irc umstanc e it would be rec kless to make way at high speed. Speed must be reduc ed. Next the engines must be on standby in c ase of an emergenc y. Relianc e on radar and VHF broadc ast is imperative. Even then c lose-quarters situation and c rossing ahead of c onverging vessels must be avoided at all c osts. Certainty of the situation must be primary objec tive. Optimistic assumptions must be avoided: pessimistic assumptions should be preferred. These are the requirements of the Collision Regulations. These are also c ommon sense rules of c aution for the avoidanc e of c ollisions at sea. Stric t adherenc e to these rules c annot be overemphasized bec ause of the huge losses non-adherenc e to them c an c ause to property and human lives. 

**_Defendants were at fault_** 

Having stated the rules I hold that the defendants` servants were inc ompetent and indiligent in the navigation of the Tai He. They c aused the Tai He to c ut the c ables bec ause first they were blind to the presenc e of the c ables, the buoys and the plaintiffs` other vessels. They should not have c ut ac ross in front of the moving buoys. There was no basis to assume that they were not under tow. Next they were indifferent to the plaintiffs` broadc ast on Channel 16. They were also blind to the flares fired by the plaintiffs` vessel. It will be remembered that the master of the Tai He stated to Mr Cunningham on 25 September 1998 that `he would never take his ship through suc h a c ongested area`. Evidenc e before me showed that his Chief Offic er did prec isely that foolhardy thing when the situation was fluid and unc ertain. In this regard I find that the witnesses of the defendants unreliable, untruthful and unintelligent as I shall now demonstrate. 

It is to be remembered that they persisted at all times that the Tai He never severed the c ables even though ac c ording to their own statements the Tai He passed in front of the tail buoys at a distanc e of about one mile. The c ables were 3.6 km long (about 2.16 miles). In the result the c ables must be c ut. The Master and Chief Offic er were unable to apprec iate this simple logic bec ause they were c onsumed by their own assumed infallibility. In c onsequenc e they threw overboard all the rules of c aution I have mentioned. 

It will be remembered that the Chief Offic er, as illustrated in exh P4, at 1602 put the distanc e between the Tai He and the c luster of boats was 1 mile on his port beam when in fac t it was 5 c ables on his port bow on a c onverging c ourse. At 1605 he gave the distanc e as 8 c ables; in fac t it was 4 c ables. At 1603.5 they first buoy was not even 3 c ables; and he never saw it. Obviously he was blind to their presenc e. He would have had no diffic ulty in sighting them at that distanc e with binoc ulars had he maintained an effic ient radar and visual lookout. 


Ac c ording to the Chief Offic er, the `big white vessel proc eeding in her opposite direc tion as shown in exh P4 was in front of the tail buoys c utting ac ross the c ables. There was unc ontradic ted evidenc e that this was entirely untrue bec ause that vessel (ac c ording to the plaintiffs a Korean vessel) passed the buoys at the rear and not in front of the buoys about ten minutes earlier. 

These fac tors c ompel me to c onc lude that the Chief Offic er was c ompletely blind to the presenc e of the buoys and other vessels belonging to the plaintiff. He c onc oc ted the evidenc e about the c luster of vessel with the help of information provided by Mr Cunningham on 25 September 1998 

There is a more likely explanation for the faulty navigation of the Tai He. It is to be noted that on 25 September 1998 those on board the Tai He prepared a report. That report c ontained the following statements. [Italic s added]. 

 All three of them said that visibility at that time was 4 to 5 miles. 

 At 1554 hours, the 2nd Officer handed over to the Chief Officer , informing him that a large ship and small ships, at a distance of 3 to 4 nautical miles were at port side. The Chief Officer observed on the radar and also using binoculars ... 

A c opy of the c ourse rec order of TAI HE was attac hed to the report. It c ontained an indorsement in Chinese whic h in English read as follows: 

 1555L hours on 18/9 record of TAI HE giving way with respect to the survey vessel. 

The report at the end c ontained the following: `All 3 offic ers on watc h and the AB have personally guaranteed that Tai He had passed the survey vessel and the small ships on the port side, and did not c ome into c ontac t with either of the ships, whic h CPA was more than 0.5 nautic al miles.` 

The c ore substanc e of all these of c ourse c ontradic ted the truth and were in effec t abandoned by the defendants. At no time Tai He gave way to the survey vessel. On a balanc e of probability the Tai He navigated merely in response to the Korean vessel`s movements and ac ted on extremely poor observation.. This is abundantly c lear bec ause those on board the Tai He made the wrong estimate of visibility of 4 to 5 miles. It was this erroneous estimate that was the probable c ause of all the subsequent faults. These wrongs were breac h of the rules of c aution I have mentioned earlier. 

The final and more important matter is the indifferenc e of those on board the Tai He to the sec urite broadc ast on Channel 16. There was no doubt at all that the broadc ast was effec ted. Further, Mr Cunningham, in the he prepared on 25 September 1998 revealed this vital statement: 

 The Officer who was on watch then stated that whilst he heard urgent Navigation Warnings being issued via VHF radio, that he was nowhere near the NORDIC EXPLORER or her equipment. 

I have no doubt at all that Mr Cunningham rec orded the truth. He impressed me as an honest witness. It was the plaintiffs` **_coup de grace_** against the defendants. The defendants` witnesses, of c ourse, 


disowned that admission. They said that they never heard it. I found that the defendants witnesses had a marked propensity to dissemble to disguise their faults and failures by tailoring their evidenc e. When all the evidenc e was analysed it bec ame c lear that those on board the Tai He were negligent and inc ompetent. That was the c ause of the stray and negligent navigation of the Tai He. The Tai He ought to have reduc ed speed and maintained a better radar, visual and auditory watc h. Had she done so the fac t that the buoys were being towed would have been apprec iated. There would have been more to properly assess the situation and the c ollision would have been averted altogether by a safe margin. The result was that the plaintiffs had made out their c ase against the defendants. 

**_Contributory negligence_** 

Having c onc luded that the defendants were negligent I now c onsider the c harges of c ontributory negligenc e. I have found that the plaintiffs had made the `sec urite` broadc asts. It was not the defendants` c ase that there was no broadc ast but that they did not hear them. To me this is unac c eptable. I find that the plaintiffs employees made the broadc ast and fired the flares. The Tai He c rew were indifferent, if not oblivious, to the obvious objec ts in the vic inity. The Tai He was navigated in a fog area at high speed. 

The plaintiffs` had just managed to divert the Korean vessel. The earliest time they c ould have realized that the Tai He bec ame a threat was shortly after 1555 when she altered c ourse to starboard. Effec tively it was at about 1558. Then, unfortunately for them, those on board had another problem. They saw a `ghost` on the starboard bow on their radar. In the meantime before they c ould take stoc k of the real situation the Tai He was approac hing a c ongested area at a breaknec k speed of 17.5 knots in restric ted visibility. It was a diffic ult situation to c ope with a moment of agony. This explains why the Tai He suc c eeded in getting away from the sc ene after severing the c ables on 18 September 1998. 

All said and done, when fac ed with a danger, espec ially when the danger is akin to a rogue elephant, the vic tim should take some steps for his self-protec tion. In this c ase, those on board the Nordic Explorer should have developed a knee jerk reac tion of diving the c ables as they did when the Korean vessel posed a threat. They should have done this even though the new situation was more c omplic ated. They had suffic ient time to do so. They failed to do so imprudently. 

I find that the other allegations of c ontributory negligenc e were fustian. They lac ked substanc e and the mark of merits. 

**_Conclusion_** 

In the result, after analyzing all the evidenc e and submissions I c ame to the c onc lusion that the defendants had to bear the greater part of the blame. I therefore held that they were to blame 60%. In doing so I deliberately was generous to them. 

## Outcome: 

Order ac c ordingly.
