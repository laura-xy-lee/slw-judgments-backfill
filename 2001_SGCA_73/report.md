## Judgment 

**(Costs)** 

1\. In our judgment delivered on 26 October 2001, we invited parties to submit written arguments on the question of costs. We have since been informed by the solicitors for Dr Yeo that parties have come to an amicable settlement on the question of costs. We accordingly make no order as to costs. The only order that is now required is one for the refund of the deposit in court, with interest, if any, to Dr Yeo or his solicitors. That order we now make.
