1       The applic ant was c harged with two others (c ollec tively referred to as “the ac c used persons”) under s 19(1)( _a_ ) of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Ac t, (Cap 257, 2001 Rev Ed) for c arrying out public entertainment without a lic enc e. The trial c ommenc ed on 25 Oc tober 2006 before a Distric t Court judge. On 27 Oc tober 2006, the applic ant filed this c riminal motion for an order dec laring a “mistrial”. The applic ation also made three other c laims, namely, that: (a) there had been a violation of Arts 9 (1)–9(3), 12 and 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the Constitution”); (b) the AttorneyGeneral had misled the c ourt and violated Arts 9 and 12 of the Constitution; and (c ) the “State Counc il” should be direc ted to advise the President of Singapore to “c onvene a Constitutional Court under Artic le 100 of the Constitution”. 

2       The fac tual basis of this applic ation arose from the presenc e of the investigating offic er for the c ase, one Assistant Superintendent of Polic e Jeremy Koh (“the investigating offic er”), in c ourt during the rec ording of the oral evidenc e of three witnesses. The first witness (“PW1”) gave evidenc e of the rec eipt of the first information report, the sec ond (“PW2”) produc ed three photographs taken at the sc ene, and the third (“PW3”) produc ed a sketc h plan of the sc ene. The ac c used persons applied to the trial judge to “abort” the trial on ac c ount of the investigating offic er’s presenc e in c ourt. The applic ation was dismissed on 27 Oc tober 2006 and, c onsequently, the applic ant filed this applic ation. The trial was thus adjourned pending the hearing of this applic ation. The applic ation c ame up for hearing before me on 30 Oc tober 2006. 

3       The main ground for making this applic ation was set out in the applic ant’s affidavit filed on 30 Oc tober 2006. In it, the applic ant c omplained that the investigating offic er had been “sitting in the c ourt from the outset of the trial and throughout the entire hearing on 25 Oc tober 2006”. He also c omplained that the deputy public prosec utor (“the DPP”) had misled the c ourt by not obtaining the c ourt’s approval for the investigating offic er to sit in during the trial. He deposed that the investigating offic er “was passing up and down the c ourt in arranging the witnesses in order to assist the DPP”. The applic ant also alleged that PW3’s presenc e in c ourt whilst the investigating offic er was on the stand was an irregularity. 

4       The applic ant was not represented before me although his previous c ounsel, one Mr M Ravi, 


appeared to assist him in c ourt. The DPP pointed out that Mr Ravi had been suspended from prac tising as an advoc ate and solic itor the previous Friday. As the proc eedings before me did not inc lude an investigation into Mr Ravi’s c onduc t or role in c ourt, I ac c epted the applic ant’s statement that Mr Ravi was not assisting him (the applic ant) as c ounsel, and that Mr Ravi’s role was limited to helping him rec ord notes of the proc eedings. In his oral argument, the applic ant submitted that the c harges against him and the other ac c used persons were politic ally motivated. He asserted the c laim, though not so stated on oath in his affidavit, that the trial judge had guided the witness in his testimony, implying that the judge was biased against the ac c used persons. He also submitted that the sketc h plan produc ed by PW3 was “flawed”. Finally, he argued that the testimonies of the prosec ution witnesses were untruthful. These were the only arguments that pertained to the applic ation brought by way of this c riminal motion. The applic ant spent a long time making a speec h of a politic al nature. Interspersed in his rhetoric were pleas for justic e and adherenc e to the rule of law. 

5 “Justic e” and “the rule of law” are c ommonly espoused values and most people have a superfic ial idea of what they c onnote. But these are also c omplex subjec ts and learned jurists have struggled at times to determine their applic ation in more diffic ult situations. Without the assistanc e of c ounsel, the applic ant was unable to artic ulate the relevanc e of these grand ideals to the c ase at hand. However, from what had been stated in his applic ation, supporting affidavit, and oral arguments, it seemed that his c laim that justic e was not done related to the presenc e of the investigating offic er and, subsequently, PW3, in c ourt and to the trial judge’s refusal to “abort” the trial when that was brought to the judge’s attention. That being all there was, the allegations of the breac h of the rule of law, and the failure of justic e, were misc onc eived. Before I set out to explain why that was so, I should first refer to the fac ts relating to the presenc e of the investigating offic er in c ourt. Witnesses are, as a general rule, required to remain outside the c ourtroom before they had given their evidenc e: see, generally, Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 460. However, the c ourt has the disc retion to make exc eptions. In c riminal proc eedings, it is not unc ommon for an investigating offic er to remain in c ourt even _before_ his evidenc e is rec orded if he is needed to assist the prosec utor, and if there has been no objec tion from the Defenc e. If there are reasons to objec t, the judge will have to determine if the objec tion is valid, and if not, he or she will be entitled to overrule the objec tion. In most c ases, there will be no objec tion from the Defenc e, espec ially during the testimonies of those who were not eyewitnesses, for example, photographers and persons who draw up sketc h plans. In this c ase, the objec tion was made fairly late in so far as PW1, PW2 and PW3 were c onc erned bec ause it appeared that the Defenc e was not aware of the offic er’s presenc e when these witnesses were giving oral evidenc e. Nothing was said as to whether the DPP had given a positive indic ation that the said offic er would not be c alled as a witness suc h as to mislead the applic ant into believing that there was no basis to objec t. There was also nothing in the affidavit or in the applic ant’s oral argument that indic ated why the presenc e of the investigating offic er during the testimonies of the three witnesses was prejudic ial to the Defenc e. As for the applic ant’s desc ription of how the investigating offic er was “passing up and down the c ourt arranging the witnesses for the DPP”, that seemed to me to be little more than part of the routine func tions of an investigating offic er in a c riminal prosec ution. 

6       I will now refer to the dic tates of justic e and the rule of law in the c ontext of the applic ant’s c ase. The term “justic e” sometimes c onnotes desert, and sometimes, fairness, and, sometimes, some vague intuitive notion of what was right in the c irc umstanc es. In the present c ase, the applic ant’s c omplaint of injustic e was really direc ted against the trial judge’s refusal to “abort” the trial. Trial judges do not “abort” the trials whic h they are trying. If there has been any wrong done whic h the judge has the power to c orrec t, then he must do his duty ac c ordingly. If any party to those proc eedings is dissatisfied with the ruling or direc tion that the judge so made, then the proper rec ourse should be for that party to reserve his objec tions until an appeal is brought against the final dec ision of the judge. It would be inappropriate and, in many instanc es, wrong, for a party to seek 


rec ourse to a higher c ourt before judgment has been handed down. This is bec ause the judge might ultimately agree with c ounsel in his submission, and rule in that party’s favour. This is prec isely the situation here. The Prosec ution had not c losed its c ase and the judge had not ruled as to whether there was a c ase for the Defenc e to answer. In these inc hoate c irc umstanc es, there was no basis upon whic h I c ould determine what the nature and extent of the injustic e was. Justic e and its mirror image, injustic e, are often determined by the c onsequenc es or imminent c onsequenc es of the ac t in question, and the interests of all parties must also be taken into ac c ount. Where a c onflic t of the respec tive interests arises suc h that one might have to ac c ommodate or give way to another, the judge will have to dec ide whic h takes prec edenc e. There was nothing imminently fatal to the applic ant’s c ase at the point when this motion was filed. If the trial judge were to subsequently find that the fac ts were in the applic ant’s favour or disc harge and ac quit him, the presenc e of the investigating offic er in the c ourtroom would not have oc c asioned any injustic e to the applic ant. The applic ant’s c omplaint about the presenc e of the investigating offic er was one that a judge is routinely expec ted to deal with. Among other suc h matters would be dec isions relating to the admissibility of evidenc e. 

7       The rule of law operates within the framework of the legal system and that, in turn, is built not only around the institutions of law but also the laws. One of the merits of the rule of law is the uniformity and predic tability of the law whic h is essential for people to know what it is that they c an or c annot do in that soc iety. The proc edure for trial and the rules of evidenc e are among matters over whic h the trial judge has full c ontrol. He makes all the rulings and dec isions that arise in the c ourse of the trial suc h as he thinks will help him c onduc t the proc eedings rightly and justly, and, ultimately, to help him arrive at the verdic t. Where a party is dissatisfied with the verdic t, he may resort, by way of the appeal proc ess, to bringing his c ase before a superior c ourt. The High Court’s revisionary jurisdic tion over a subordinate c ourt’s proc eedings is one way through whic h matters that do not normally fall within the appeal proc ess might nevertheless be brought before the High Court. Where the appeal proc ess is available, as is the c ase here, the High Court’s revisionary jurisdic tion should not liberally be invoked. The filing of a c riminal motion c ertainly c annot be used to interrupt a trial eac h time a party is unhappy with any ruling that the trial judge makes in the c ourse of a trial. A trial judge would have to make numerous rulings in the c ourse of a trial; eac h ruling would be adverse to one if not the other party, and sometimes to both. The trial will be c onstantly interrupted if every ruling is c hallenged before the trial has ended. The flow and dignity of a trial interrupted in suc h fashion tarnishes the image of the rule of law. There may, of c ourse, be exc eptions to any law; otherwise, equity would have no role in shaping justic e in areas where the law is inadequate. The question then is: did the applic ant’s c ase fall within any exc eption? He made no referenc e to any exc eptional c irc umstanc es. And I found nothing exc eptional in his – apart from the applic ant’s attempt to disrupt the trial at the inc ipient stage for the reason that the investigating offic er was present in c ourt when three witnesses were giving their evidenc e. 

8       Finally, justic e and the rule of law require that only relevant issues are addressed. The issue raised by the applic ant in this motion was the alleged wrongful refusal by the trial judge to “abort” the trial. It was a straightforward point that, for reasons above, I am of the view had no merit in law. This applic ation did not have any greater or spec ial signific anc e bec ause the applic ant alleged that the c ase against him was “politic ally motivated”. The motives of any party in presenting or defending a c ase generally have no relevanc e unless it was made so by reason of the pleadings, as in the c ase of c ivil proc eedings. In c riminal c ases, only the motives of the ac c used and the c omplainant might bec ome an issue at the trial, but that is a matter for the trial judge to dec ide. Politic al motives and manoeuvres have no relevanc e no matter whic h party was involved – whether the party who initiated the proc eedings or the party wishing to disrupt it. The c ourt is only c onc erned with the legal issues and no more. 


9       For the reasons above, the applic ation was dismissed.
