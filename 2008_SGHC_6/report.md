Choo Han Tec k J: 

1       The appellant, Balakrishnan A/L Sannasy, and a c o-ac c used, one Muthurumaran Ramasamy, pleaded guilty before me on a c harge of traffic king in not less than 14.99g of diamorphine. The c harge was brought under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Ac t (Cap 185), 2001 Rev Ed and s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), 1985 Rev Ed. The offenc e was c ommitted on 5 Dec ember 2006 at or about 8.45pm in the vic inity of a Mc Donald’s restaurant loc ated at the East Coast Park. Both ac c used pleaded guilty to the c harge. 

2       From the statement of fac ts that both ac c used persons admitted without qualific ation, the appellant was c aught in an entrapment exerc ise by the Central Narc otic s Bureau (“CNB”). He was the one who established c ontac t with an underc over agent of the CNB to whom he sold and delivered the drugs in question. At the meeting he handed the drugs to the said underc over agent. The sec ond ac c used admitted to be the person who obtained the drugs for the appellant to sell. It was also noted in the statement of fac ts that the appellant owed the sec ond ac c used money whic h he had hoped to repay by selling the drugs. On the evening when the arrests were made, the sec ond ac c used was merely “loitering” in the vic inity. 

3       In mitigation, c ounsel for the appellant pleaded that the appellant had an unhappy domestic life as he had a 14-year-old son who was born with a mental retardation, and also that he and his wife did not earn enough to provide money for his family’s medic al expenses. He expressed remorse and had no previous antec edents. I sentenc ed both ac c used persons to 24 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the c ane. There was no appeal by the sec ond ac c used. 

4       The offenc e was punishable with mandatory c aning of not less than 15 strokes and a term of imprisonment of not less than 20 years and not more than 30 years. The fac ts of this c ase were straightforward with nothing exc eptionally harsh nor aggravating. The mitigating fac tors were similarly not suffic ient in my view to merit the minimum sentenc e of 20 years. It is true that I might have ordered a term of slightly less than 24 years, say 22, but I c ould also have imposed a slightly longer sentenc e of say 25 or 26 years. It is diffic ult to say whic h length of time would be the c orrec t one in suc h a c ase. I thought a term of 24 years with effec t from 5 Dec ember 2006 to be a fair one.
