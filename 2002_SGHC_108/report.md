## Judgment 

### GROUNDS OF DECISION 

1\. The plaintiff in these proc eedings, Han Min, is a c ustomer of the first defendant, First Commerc ial Bank ("the bank"). The sec ond defendant Kyone Yeom Group Co Pte Ltd ("KYGC") is also a c ustomer of the bank. The third defendant Hu Hua is a direc tor and majority shareholder of KYGC. 

2\. Eac h party was represented in c ourt when the hearing started, but c ounsel for the sec ond and third defendants disc harged themselves in the c ourse of the trial and thereafter these two defendants were not in c ourt themselves or by c ounsel to present their defenc es. 

3\. The plaintiff’s relationship with the bank had c ommenc ed when an ac c ount was provisionally opened for him on 14 August 2000. After that, the plaintiff remitted HK$8,799,600 to the ac c ount on 18 August ("the first remittanc e"), followed by a further sum of HK$339,600 on 22 August ("the sec ond remittanc e"). 

4\. The plaintiff c ame to Singapore on 23 August. He went to the bank to attend to the formalities of opening the ac c ount, and he gave instruc tions that the two remittanc es were to be plac ed in monthly fixed deposits. 

5\. His next visit was on the following day 24 August when he signed a doc ument. The doc ument exec uted is a memorandum of lien ("the first memorandum"). The effec t of this doc ument is to pledge the deposits to the bank as sec urity for fac ilities the bank granted to KYGC. 

6\. The first and sec ond remittanc es were followed by two other remittanc es on 22 September in the sums of HK$1,019,600 and HK$8,179,600. The plaintiff then made another visit to the bank on 25 September. During this visit, he had his deposits c onverted into Singapore c urrenc y. He also signed another memorandum of lien ("the sec ond memorandum"). The effec t of this doc ument is to pledge all the four deposits to the bank as sec urity for fac ilities extended to KYGC. When KYGC defaulted on its repayments to the bank, the bank uplifted the plaintiff’s deposits under the first and/or sec ond memorandum to set-off the debt. 

7\. The plaintiff c laimed that he did not know that the two doc uments he exec uted were pledges and 


that he was misled by the offic ers of the bank into signing them. In these proc eedings he primarily wanted the memoranda to be dec lared null and void and his deposits to be restored. 

8\. His c laim against KYGC was based on the premise that if the bank was entitled to uplift his deposits, he was entitled to be indemnified by KYGC as it was the borrower. The plaintiff also c laimed that if these deposits were uplifted, he was entitled to c ontribution from Hu Hua as a c o-surety bec ause Hu Hua had given a guarantee to the bank for KYGC’s fac ilities. 

9\. Hu Hua took out third party proc eedings against the bank. His c laim proc eeded on the basis that the guarantee he gave to the bank in c onnec tion to fac ilities granted to KYGC was not valid and that he was entitled to be indemnified by the bank for any liability that he may inc ur towards the plaintiff as a c o-surety. 

_The plaintiff’s case_ 

10\. The plaintiff is a Chinese national and resident. He was born in 1968, so he was about 32 years old when the events oc c urred. He was educ ated in the Chinese medium. After c ompleting sc hool he obtained a diploma in Enterprise Management from Shenzhen University in 1987. He was taught basic English in sc hool and university, but he had largely forgotten it bec ause he did not use it. He had invested well in the stoc k market in China and ac c umulated some wealth. 

11\. He visited Singapore in August 1999 and was impressed with what he saw, and intended to settle himself and his family here. In July 2000 he applied for permanent residenc e for himself and his family. He engaged Dr Choong Chow Siong ("Choong") of Choong Management Consultants Pte Ltd to advise and assist in the applic ation. He was informed that he c ould partic ipate in an investment sc heme with the Ec onomic Development Board under whic h he would have to invest $1.5m within three months of obtaining in-princ iple approval of his applic ation. To demonstrate the seriousness of his intention, the plaintiff stated in his applic ation that he would make the investment within half a month of the in- princ iple approval. He was also c onsidering buying a family home and had viewed some apartments with a housing agent. 

12\. When he was preparing to remit his funds to Singapore, a business assoc iate in China, Mdm Long Qiong Zhen rec ommended that he remitted them to the First Commerc ial Bank. Mdm Long was also a business assoc iate of Hu Hua and rec ommended the bank bec ause of Hu Hua’s c lose c onnec tions with it. 

13\. The plaintiff made the first two remittanc es to the bank before c ompleting the formalities for opening an ac c ount. He followed that up by c oming to Singapore on 22 August. Hu Hua whom he had met in China through Mdm Long rec eived him with warm hospitality. He hosted a dinner for him, put him up in a suite at Raffles Town Club and arranged for a sec retary and a c ar to take him to the bank. 

14\. When he went to the bank the next morning, he was rec eived and attended to by Cheng Jung- Sen ("Cheng") and Wu Tzyy- Arng ("Wu"), both Assistant Vic e- Presidents and Deputy General Managers of the bank. He signed some doc uments whic h Cheng explained to him and left. In the afternoon he returned to the bank after he was informed by Hu Hua that he needed to sign further doc uments. Cheng suggested that he put his money in fixed deposit. When he expressed c onc ern over his ac c ess to the funds, Cheng assured him that he would still have ac c ess to the funds if they were plac ed in renewable monthly deposits. He ac c epted the advic e and signed a fixed deposit agreement. 


15\. The next morning Hu Hua told him to go to the bank again and sign some more doc uments. When he arrived at the bank Cheng produc ed another doc ument for him to sign whic h Cheng explained would make it possible for future remittanc es to be plac ed in fixed deposits without his attendanc e at the bank. He signed the doc ument and left the bank without being given a c opy of it. At that time the blank spac es in the doc ument were not filled exc ept for his signature and his Singapore address. (This doc ument is the first memorandum of 24 August). 

16\. On 25 September the plaintiff made another visit to the bank. His intention was to c onvert his Hong Kong c urrenc y deposits to Singapore c urrenc y, and to transfer them to the United Overseas Bank ("UOB") where he also had an ac c ount. Cheng attended to him and told him that the bank c an c onvert the deposits for him at an attrac tive exc hange rate. After verifying the rates he took up the suggestion and instruc ted the deposits be c onverted, thereafter $4m was to be retained in the bank a nd the balanc e $110,311.22 transferred to his ac c ount at UOB. He c onfirmed his instruc tions by signing on the deposit slips for the four deposits. He also signed another doc ument whic h Cheng said was required to fac ilitate the c onversion. (This doc ument is the sec ond memorandum of 25 September). No c opies of these doc uments were given to him. 

17\. He returned to China on 30 September. Just before he left, he asked his friend Kenny Cai Wen Xing ("Cai") to c hec k with the bank on the c onversion on his behalf. On 6 Oc tober Cai telephoned and informed him that he had been to the bank and obtained a doc ument whic h appeared to be a pledge. 

18\. On hearing this, he dec ided to c ome to Singapore to investigate. On 9 Oc tober, he went to the bank with Choong and they saw Cheng. He informed Cheng that he wanted to withdraw his deposits but was told that he c ould not do that bec ause they had been pledged to sec ure loans given to Hu Hua. Cheng gave him two c opies of the doc ument he signed on 24 August, with some of the blanks filled up. 

19\. Later that day he went to Cai’s house, whic h was also his Singapore address for his ac c ount with the bank. Cai gave him some doc uments the bank had sent there, inc luding the deposit slips he signed on 25 September, eac h bearing a red stamp that was not there before. Cai also handed to him the doc ument he c ollec ted from the bank on 6 Oc tober. This was a c opy of the doc ument he signed on 25 September (the sec ond memorandum). 

20\. On the following day he c onsulted Choong on the doc uments and was told that the stamp on the deposit slips indic ated that they were pledged. That afternoon they went to the bank again. They met with Cheng and Wu and asked to see the sec ond memorandum. After waiting for about 45 minutes, they were given a c opy of the sec ond memorandum with the spac es previously left blank now filled in. He asked to see the doc ument but it was not produc ed. Instead the c opy was c ertified as a true c opy and handed to him. When they insisted on inspec ting the original, Wu told them it was not possible bec ause the doc ument was being examined by offic ers of the Monetary Authority of Singapore at that time – a reason subsequently ac knowledged to be untrue. 

21\. He was unhappy over the lien, and when the bank uplifted his deposits bec ause KYGC failed to repay its loans, he c ommenc ed these proc eedings. 

_The bank’s case_ 

22\. The bank’s response to the plaintiff’s c omplaints was quite remarkable, partic ularly for an establishment suc h as a bank. When the plaintiff’s solic itors at that time Joo Toon & Co, wrote to the bank and stated that the memorandum of 24 August had relevant details left blank when it was 


signed, the bank’s solic itors Chee & Teo replied on 24 Oc tober to deny that in c lear terms – 

 Our clients’ banking practice do not allow customers to sign blank documents. 

 Your c lient’s allegation of signing on a ‘blank doc ument’ is untrue. The Memorandum of Lien c ontained important details such as Name of the borrower and date which were inserted before your client executed the same. 

 (Emphasis added) 

23\. The bank retrac ted from this position later. Wu explained that the position was taken bec ause the bank misunderstood a blank doc ument to be a blank piec e of paper when it instruc ted Chee & Teo on the matter. This explanation did not ac c ord with the fac t that the plaintiff was not c omplaining of signing on blank sheets, and the reply referred spec ific ally to a memorandum of lien. 

24\. After the ac tion was c ommenc ed the bank referred to the exec ution of the two memoranda in its defenc e, then it amended it substantially. In the amended defenc e it reversed itself on the events leading to and following the exec ution of the two memoranda. 

25\. In the defenc e filed on 6 Dec ember 2000, the bank pleaded in c onnec tion with the events of 24 August that (i) the memorandum was signed by the plaintiff "in esc row" with the partic ulars to be filled in later, (ii) Cheng and Wu _did not explain the contents, meaning and effect_ of the doc ument to t he plaintiff bec ause he did not request for it and (iii) it was "not the bank’s usual prac tic e to give c ustomers c opies of the forms whic h they had signed unless spec ific ally requested for by the c ustomers", and _no copy was given_ to the plaintiff bec ause he did not request for it. In the amended defenc e filed on 21 February 2001, the bank pleaded that (i) the memorandum was signed in blank, (ii) Wu produc ed the memorandum and _explained its nature, contents and effect_ s and (iii) the plaintiff was _given a copy_ of the doc ument bec ause he had asked for it. 

26\. In relation to the events of 25 September and the sec ond memorandum the bank pleaded in its defenc e that _no copy of the memorandum was given_ to the plaintiff bec ause he had not requested for it. In the amended defenc e, however, the position taken was that _a copy of the memorandum was given_ to the plaintiff upon his request, and that "Cheng/Wu" explained it to the plaintiff before he signed it. 

_The issues_ 

27\. Many issues were raised in the pleadings and the submissions, in my view too many. Some were not developed or followed up in the c losing submissions and others were dealt with at length whic h were not really germane to the basic dispute or its determination. 

28\. Keeping the foc us on the dispute, I see the issues to be – 

 (i) whether the plaintiff read and understood the memoranda on his own, 

 (ii) whether the memoranda were properly explained to him when he signed them, 

 (iii) whether c opies of the memoranda were given to him when he signed them, 

 (iv) whether he had agreed to pledge his deposits to sec ure KYGC’s fac ilities, and 


 (v) whether the bank had reason to obtain the pledges without his knowledge. 

_Whether the plaintiff read and understood the memoranda on his own_ 

29\. The plaintiff had the memoranda before him when he signed them. If he c ould read them on his own, he would have known what he signed without explanation from anyone. 

30\. The plaintiff said that he c ould not read them with his limited knowledge of English, but c ounsel for the bank c ontended that with eight years’ instruc tion on the language in sc hool and university, the plaintiff would be able to read the memoranda. The memoranda were not written in simple English but in typic al legal manner whic h a person c onversant in English with no legal training may find diffic ult to understand. 

31\. There was really nothing to suggest that the plaintiff was more c onversant in English than he c laimed. He dealt with Cheng and Wu in Mandarin, and wrote to the bank in Chinese, and there was no evidenc e that he had c onversed or c orresponded with anyone in English. In any event, there was little inc entive for the plaintiff to try and read and understand the memoranda on his own when the bank offic ers had explained them to him. (The dispute is not whether explanations were given, but whether proper explanations were given). 

_Whether the memoranda were properly explained to the plaintiff_ 

_The first memorandum_ 

32\. The bank stated in its defenc e that it was not explained to the plaintiff, then it asserted in the amended defenc e that "Cheng/Wu" had explained it. The bank’s evidenc e c reated further c onfusion bec ause Wu said at one stage that he explained the nature of the doc ument, then he said he did not explain it. Cheng on his part deposed that he explained the nature of the doc ument to the plaintiff. 

33\. The plaintiff’s c omplaint was that he did not know that he was signing a pledge. If Cheng and Wu explained the nature of the memorandum to the plaintiff, why did the bank state in its defenc e that there was no explanation? Wu c ould only say that there was misc ommunic ation of the instruc tions bec ause they did not explain the entire lien, only the nature of it. This did not ac c ord with the defenc e that neither he nor Cheng explained the _contents, meaning and effect_ of the doc ument, if they both had explained its _nature_. If the plaintiff was told of the nature of the memorandum, he would have known that it was a pledge, and that should have been pleaded. 

_The second memorandum_ 

34\. The bank’s defenc e was silent on whether this memorandum was explained to the plaintiff. The amended defenc e asserted that it was explained to him by "Cheng/Wu" Neither of them said that in their affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief. Wu in his evidenc e in c ourt took the opposite position when he said that bec ause the first memorandum was explained already, the sec ond memorandum was not explained by him or Cheng. 

_Whether copies of the memoranda were given to the plaintiff_ 


_The first memorandum_ 

35\. The bank reversed its position on whether a c opy of the first memorandum was given to the plaintiff. Cheng’s explanation was that initially he c ould not rec all very c learly whether he had given it, but he remembered that later. Again this did not tie in with the defenc e whic h was positive in its terms that the plaintiff did not ask for a c opy and was not given one. 

36\. The plaintiff also c ontributed to the c onfusion. The List of Doc uments filed on 16 January 2001 by his original solic itors, Joo Toon & Co inc luded a blank c opy of the first memorandum, but no suc h doc ument was produc ed for inspec tion. Their suc c essors explained that the doc ument was listed in error and pointed out the plaintiffs’ position before and in the c ommenc ement of the ac tion on 9 November 2000 had been c onsistent that he was not given a c opy of the doc ument, but no c lear explanation was offered as to how the mistake oc c urred. 

_The second memorandum_ 

37\. The plaintiff’s c ase is that he did not have a c opy of this memorandum until Cai obtained a c opy of it from the bank on 6 Oc tober. 

38\. In its defenc e the bank defenc e agreed that he was not given a c opy, but turned around in its amended defenc e and asserted that a c opy of the lien was given to him. 

39\. In his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief Cai deposed that the plaintiff had asked him on 30 September to go to the bank to c hec k on the c onversion of the plaintiff’s deposits. He did not go to the bank till 6 Oc tober. When he went to the bank Cheng referred him to Ms Tan Bee Kuan ("Ms Tan"). Ms Tan brought out a file and showed him a deposit slip bearing the notation $4m and the interest rate. 

40\. He notic ed another doc ument in the file, a blank doc ument bearing the plaintiff’s signature, whic h Ms Tan said was a guarantee. He asked for, and was given a c opy of it. (The doc ument exhibited by Cai in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief is a blank Memorandum of Lien on Fixed Deposits with the blanks empty exc ept for the plaintiff’s signature and Wu’s signature as witness. This doc ument with the other blanks filled in is the sec ond memorandum.) 

41\. That evening a friend told him it was a pledge or guarantee of some sort. He telephoned the plaintiff and told him about the doc ument. The plaintiff’s response was that he had not signed any pledge or guarantee and that he would bring forward his trip to Singapore to find out more. 

42\. Ms Tan agreed that Cai saw her on 6 Oc tober. She deposed in her affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief 

that "I showed him the Memorandum of Lien of Fixed Deposit with partic ulars filled in dated 25th September 2000" and informed him that it was for the plaintiff to pledge his deposit to KYGC, and " (a)fter seeing the said doc ument he said he did not require a c opy of it anymore." 

43\. In her evidenc e in c ourt she was less c ertain about the doc ument she showed him. She said she took out the lien from a file and showed it to Cai. She did not look at the date of the lien and believed it to be the one dated September. She knew that the plaintiff had signed an earlier memorandum and asked Cai whic h memorandum he wanted, but Cai was undec ided and wanted to c hec k with the plaintiff. (This ac c ount c ontradic ted her affidavit and the amended defenc e that Cai did not want a c opy.) 

44\. Her evidenc e was also inc onsistent with the amended defenc e whic h stated that she had taken a 


file, not just one doc ument, and showed it to Cai. When this was brought to her attention her response was that she had objec ted to this part of the amended defenc e, but nothing was done about it. 

45\. Questions rose from her evidenc e. Why did she take out one memorandum when she knew there to be two of them? Why did she or Cai not do the reasonable and sensible thing and take c opies of both doc uments? If Cai wanted to seek the plaintiff’s further instruc tions, why was that not stated instead of saying and pleading that he did not want a c opy of the doc ument? If she objec ted to the mistake in the amended defenc e, why was that ignored? 

_Whether the plaintiff agreed to pledge his deposits to secure KYGC’s facilities_ 

46\. The plaintiff’s c ase is that he did not know of KYGC and had not agreed to pledge his deposits to sec ure its fac ilities. KYGC is a c ompany c ontrolled by Hu Hua in whic h the plaintiff had no interest, and with whic h he had no dealings. The plaintiff and Hu Hua had agreed to go into a joint venture to invest in the stoc k market in China with funds to be provided by Hu Hua. The venture was c onc eived during the plaintiff’s visit to Singapore in August. It did not involve KYGC in any way, and was aborted in the following month. 

47\. There appears to be very little reason or purpose for the plaintiff to pledge his deposits for the benefit of KYGC. He had earmarked part of the funds to sec ure permanent residenc e for himself and his family, and he would need funds to buy a house. By pledging the deposits, his funds c annot be used for either purpose. 

48\. He was anxious that his funds were not tied up. Cheng c onfirmed that the plaintiff wanted to be assured that he would be able to withdraw the deposits when he needed to. Yet Cheng’s evidenc e was that when the plaintiff visited the bank on 25 September to withdraw all his funds and was advised that he c ould only withdraw the third and fourth deposits, he gave instruc tions to pledge all four remittanc es. 

49\. Cheng’s ac c ount of the plaintiff’s behaviour was quite extraordinary. He started off wanting to withdraw all his money, and when told he c ould only withdraw a part of it, he not only dec ided not to withdraw what he c an, but proc eeded to pledge the balanc e as well. 

_Whether the bank had reason to obtain the pledges without the plaintiff’s knowledge_ 

50\. Underlying the allegations and disputes is the question why the bank would obtain the plaintiff’s pledges by stealth as he alleged. A bank would want to keep its c ustomers, and would not do anything to antagonise them unless there is some c ause for it. 

51\. To deal with this question it is nec essary to examine Hu Hua’s and KYGC’s relationship with the bank. Hu Hua evidently presents himself very well to people he met. He c reated a favourable impression on the plaintiff. Mr Lin Hann- Chyi, the bank’s General Manager testified that he was happy to have him as a c lient, and c onsidered his c ompany as a c ustomer of great potential as Hu Hua had dec lared his intention to loc ate his financ ial c entre in Singapore. 

52\. KYGC sought fac ilities from the bank by an applic ation form dated 11 February 2000. The applic ation submitted was for US$5m sec ured overdraft and US$50m for trust rec eipts. Added to these in handwriting was an applic ation for $200,000 unsec ured overdraft whic h was inserted on 


Cheng’s instruc tions. 

53\. The bank made two offers in response to this applic ation. The first was on 21 February offering US$5m in sec ured overdraft and the same amount in trust rec eipts. The sec ond offer of 22 February was for the same fac ilities and an additional line of $200,000 unsec ured overdraft. 

54\. Ms Tan Bee Kuan (the same offic er who dealt with Cai), a Spec ial Grade Clerk with 20 years servic e with the bank proc essed the applic ation. She had written in the additional fac ility into KYGC’s applic ation form on the instruc tions of her manager. She wanted KYGC to submit a new applic ation for all three lines, but the c ompany did not return the form that she despatc hed to it for that purpose. She had also requested for the financ ial statements of KYGC and a board resolution ac c epting the offered fac ilities. 

55\. Of the doc uments required, she only rec eived the board resolution, and only in July. She nevertheless proc essed the applic ation without the absent doc uments, and prepared a c redit report on 17 July in whic h she c onc luded that the c ompany was tec hnic ally insolvent with c urrent liabilities exc eeding c urrent assets by $998,705. 

56\. Nevertheless the unsec ured line was offered. Not only that, it was allowed to be operated by KYGC even before the offer was made or ac c epted, when the c ompany drew five c heques on the line between 17-21 February. 

57\. Ms Tan was questioned on these unusual happenings - 

 Q: So this would be a unique c ase bec ause there was non-c omplianc e, unsec ured c redit line of $200,000, yet the ac c ount was ac tivated for several months? 

 A: I c an’t answer the question. You must ask my manager. 

 Q: In your rec ollec tion, has there been any other c ase beside KYGC of an unsec ured loan, where doc umentation is not c omplete, no financ ial statements or c redit report, yet the loan is ac tivated? 

 A: No. 

 Q: The full $200,000 was utilised before your c redit report? 

 A: Yes. 

 Q: Wouldn’t you, with your 5 years experienc e regard this as an unusual experienc e? 

 A: I rather not answer. I c annot say it is usual or unusual. It is a rare oc c urrenc e. 

58\. A pic ture emerges of a favoured c lient being ac c orded spec ial treatment. This setting lends c redibility to the plaintiff’s c omplaint that the bank misled him into signing the two memoranda so that KYGC c an draw on its sec ured line. The bank’s revolving positions and the bank offic ers’ evidenc e did little to dispel that. 

59\. The plaintiff’s c omplaints raise serious c harges against the bank whic h must be c onsidered 


c arefully. I took into ac c ount all the evidenc e, partic ularly the plaintiff’s reasons for sending his funds to Singapore, his relationship (ac tually the absenc e of it) with KYGC, and the bank’s c ase on the exec ution of the memoranda and the management of the KYGC ac c ount before arriving at my findings. 

_My findings_ 

60\. After examining and reviewing the matters c arefully, I find that the plaintiff had proved on a balanc e of probabilities that he was not aware that the doc uments he exec uted were pledges, and that he had been misled by the bank offic ers. 

61\. I ac c ept that the plaintiff was not able to read and understand the memoranda on his own. I do not ac c ept that either Cheng or Wu had explained the true nature of the doc uments to him, or had given him c opies of them. Between the ac c ounts of Cheng and Wu and that of the plaintiff, I prefer the plaintiff’s evidenc e on the explanations given. I find that the plaintiff had not intended or agreed to pledge his deposit to sec ure KYGC’s fac ilities. 

62\. In the result I dec lare that the memoranda are not binding on the plaintiff and I order that his deposits are to be restored together with suc h interest whic h would have ac c rued had they not been uplifted. I leave it to the parties to c ompute the quantum of interest, and if they c annot agree, the matter is to be referred bac k to me. The plaintiff shall also have his c osts from the bank, and I order that they be taxed for two c ounsel. 

63\. As the plaintiff had proc eeded against KYGC and Hu Hua on the basis that the memoranda were binding, these c laims are dismissed. There shall be no c osts to the defendants who had absented themselves. 

64\. Finally, Hu Hua’s c laim against the bank is dismissed with c osts for two c ounsel to be taxed.
