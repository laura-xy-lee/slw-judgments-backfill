_Companies_ – _Schemes of arrangement_ 

23 September 2015 

**Aedit Abdullah JC [delivering the oral judgment]:** 

1       I made a number of brief oral remarks when c onveying my dec ision on an applic ation under s 210(1) of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Ac t”) by Sembawang Engineers and Construc tors Pte Ltd (“the Company”) for it to be granted liberty to c onvene a meeting with its c reditors, within six months or suc h other extended period ordered by the c ourt, for the purpose of c onsidering and, if thought fit, approving with or without modific ation a sc heme of arrangement proposed to be made between the Company and its c reditors (the “Proposed Sc heme”). My remarks are set out below. 

2       While an applic ation of this nature is normally heard _ex parte_ , a number of c reditors of the Company as well as its related entity, Punj Lloyd Pte Limited, were present in c ourt as this applic ation was sc heduled together with other winding-up applic ations, and several of them had been informed of the applic ation. Three of the c reditors had also presented applic ations to wind-up the Company. These applic ations were sc heduled for hearing before me on the same day. Counsel for Rigel Tec hnology (S) Pte Ltd (“Rigel”), one of the c reditors applying for the Company to be wound-up, opposed the Company’s s 210(1) applic ation. 

3       In written submissions, whic h were well prepared despite the lac k of time, Rigel argued that the Company’s Proposed Sc heme was lac king in details and that the Proposed Sc heme was not likely to be approved by the c ourt given its lac k of spec ific ity. It also pointed out that some of the measures in the Proposed Sc heme were c onditional upon Punj Lloyd Pte Ltd and Punj Lloyd Ltd (the Company’s ultimate India inc orporated holding c ompany) c arrying out c ertain ac tions or sec uring relevant approvals whic h were matters that the c reditors of the Company had no c ontrol over. It was also argued that the applic ation should be refused as the Company was hopelessly insolvent: _Re Pheon Pty Ltd_ (1986) 11 ACLR 142. It was suggested that insolvenc y was to be measured in the c ommerc ial sense – _ie_ , the inability to meet c urrent demands: _Sri Hartamas Development Sdn Bhd v MBf Finance Bhd_ [1990] 2 MLJ 31. It was argued that the c ompany was hopelessly insolvent as there was a c lear shortfall to meet c urrent demands. The winding-up applic ations against the Company were also c ited as reasons to refuse the applic ation, as was also the lac k of any assuranc e that the Company c ould c ontinue as a going c onc ern. 


4       In oral submissions, c ounsel for the Company responded that notwithstanding the fac t that the Proposed Sc heme was not c omplete, it had given adequate details c onc erning the same. As to the measures c onc erning the related c ompanies, it was argued that these were legitimately inc luded sinc e they will ultimately benefit the Company. Further, c ounsel c ontended that the Company was not hopelessly insolvent, although it may be so on a balanc e sheet test. It was also pointed out that the Company had support from the rest of the c ompanies in the group it was part of. 

5       Having c onsidered these arguments, I dec ided to allow the Company’s applic ation under s 210(1) of the Companies Ac t, although with modific ation of the time granted for c onvening the meeting with the Company’s c reditors. I ordered that suc h a meeting be c alled within four months as opposed to six months, as suggested by the Company. I did not think that signific ant issues were raised by the arguments based on firstly, lac k of details c onc erning the Proposed Sc heme and sec ondly, the lac k of c ontrol by the Company’s c reditors over measures c onditional upon third party ac tions. The following remarks primarily c onc ern the issue of whether a c ompany’s ‘hopeless’ insolvenc y should be an automatic bar to allowing that c ompany’s applic ation under s 210(1) of the Companies Ac t: 

 (a) The objec tive of s 210 of the Companies Ac t is to permit c ompanies in financ ial diffic ulties to seek a way out by way of an agreement worked out with their respec tive c reditors. In assessing whether a meeting should be held, the c ourt will need to be mindful of various fac tors, whic h may point in different direc tions. The c ompany should generally be permitted to at least have a disc ussion with its c reditors and allow them to c onsider its proposed sc heme of arrangement. But it would be pointless to allow the c ompany to c onvene a meeting with its c reditors to c onsider a proposal whic h, on its fac e, is doomed to fail or be rejec ted by the c reditors. It is in this c ontext that the c ourt may look to see whether the c ompany’s debts are so overwhelming that any sc heme of arrangement proposed by the c ompany would have no c hanc e of garnering suffic ient c reditor support. With all due respec t, I dec line to adopt the test of balanc e sheet or c ommerc ial insolvenc y as a determining fac tor in an applic ation under s 210(1) of the Companies Ac t. Many c ompanies may be insolvent and hopelessly insolvent by this measure, but sc hemes of arrangement may be proposed, whic h depending on the fac ts, may yet be viable. The Malaysian and Australian authorities take a different line, but I would respec tfully not follow those c ases. 

 (b) It would be diffic ult for the c ourt to make any searc hing assessment of the c ommerc ial viability of a proposed sc heme of arrangement at this stage as it would not have all the information. However, the c ourt should be c areful to ensure that the interests of c reditors are not affec ted by the c lass groupings and voting mec hanisms that are proposed – although I note that this was not in issue in this c ase. The c ourt should also be mindful that the interests of c reditors are not unduly harmed by any undue delay or lapse of time before the meeting is held. Beyond these fac tors though, s 210 of the Companies Ac t envisages that the c reditors should look after their own positions and express these at the meeting, and vote ac c ordingly. 

 (c ) I note that the Company and Punj Lloyd Pte Ltd are involved in a great many projec ts with many c reditors. That would be a fac tor that would weigh in favour of allowing a sc heme of arrangement to be c onsidered by the c reditors. 

6       Counsel for the Company, in my view rightfully, did not ask for c osts. 

7       I will hear the parties separately on another date on the Company’s applic ation for a restraint order under s 210(10) of the Companies Ac t. I ordered an interim restraint order pending the hearing of that matter.
