Choo Han Tec k J: 

1       The ac c used pleaded guilty to a c harge of c ulpable homic ide not amounting to murder, an offenc e punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The offenc e took plac e 20 years ago when he was 29 years old. He fled to Thailand after he c ommitted the offenc e and was subsequently inc arc erated in a Thai prison until his release in July last year. He was remanded in Singapore on 29 Dec ember 2006. 

2       The offenc e in question took plac e on 27 Marc h 1987 in the early hours between 2.20am and 3.35am. An Indonesian man by the name of Edy Tan was drinking with three of his friends at the lane behind Amoy Street. The ac c used rode his bic yc le past the four men and then went bac k and asked Edy Tan why he had stared at the ac c used. A quarrel ensued and soon there was a fight. It was not disputed that Edy Tan was a muc h heavier man than the ac c used, but he did not start the quarrel leading to the fight, and neither was he armed. There was no suggestion that his three friends were involved in the fight. 

3       Although the ac c used had an antec edent for c ausing grievous hurt, it was an offenc e that took plac e in 1979. He was imprisoned for a day and fined $500 for that offenc e. It was not known why he was imprisoned in Thailand but that was not relevant for the purpose of sentenc ing in this present c ase espec ially when no details of that situation was made known to this Court. 

4       Mr Subhas Anandan, c ounsel for the ac c used, pleaded in mitigation that the ac c used might have started the quarrel but he did not inflic t the first blow. He said that Edy Tan was the aggressor in that sense. He also urged the c ourt to note that there was only a single fatal slash wound although there were five other knife injuries. Mr Anandan also urged me not to impose c aning on ac c ount of the fac t that the ac c used will be 50 years old next Marc h, whic h is barely six months away. DPP Franc is Ng submitted that a term of eight to ten years imprisonment as well as an order for c aning would be appropriate. 

5       On the agreed fac ts and after c onsideration of c ounsels’ submissions, I am of the view that a term of imprisonment of nine years would be appropriate and I so ordered. The sentenc e was to take 


effec t from 29 Dec ember 2006 when the ac c used was remanded after his extradition.
