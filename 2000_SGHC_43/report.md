2       The 6th Charge originally alleged that he had "voluntarily caused hurt" but that w as amended at the close of the case for the Defence to "voluntarily caused w rongful restraint". 

### THE PROSECUTION’S CASE 

3       The Complainant is 26 years old and single. She resides in the public housing estate of Toa Payoh w ith her parents and tw o sisters. The Complainant had formal education up to Primary 6 level. She w as able to speak in simple English but w as more fluent in Mandarin. 

4       After completing her primary school education, she did not look for employment until some three years later. She then w orked in various factories until about six years ago w hen she stopped w orking altogether as she could not cope w ith her w ork. She has been unemployed since that time. 

5       A psychological assessment of her intellect conducted by Dr Helen Chen of Woodbridge Hospital in June 1999 revealed that "she w as functioning in the borderline range of intelligence". The doctor also opined that "her understanding of sexual intercourse and contact is fairly adequate, and she is fully competent to give consent to sexual intercourse". 

6       On 3 June 1999, the Complainant w as w atching television in her Toa Payoh flat. At around 9 pm, she felt hungry and decided to go to Kopitiam (a food centre) at the Meridien Hotel in Orchard Road as many of the food stalls in her neighbourhood w ere already closed. She travelled by the Mass Rapid Transit to the Somerset Station and then w alked to the Meridien Hotel. 

7       She spent about one and a quarter hours at the food centre. After having her meal, she had only some coins left. Although it w as around midnight by then, she decided to w alk all the w ay home to Toa Payoh. She had done this more than ten times previously and thought it w as alright for her to do so again that night. The long trek home finally brought her to the bus interchange at Block 190 Toa Payoh Central. 

8       It w as about 2 am on 4 June 1999 by then. Feeling thirsty after the long w alk from Orchard Road, the Complainant w ent into the 7-Eleven shop at Block 190 to purchase a packet of drink w ith the coins that she had. She then w ent out of the shop. 

9       When she w as outside the shop, the Accused (w ho w as unknow n to her then) asked her in English w hy she w as rushing out and w hether she had paid for the drink. She replied that she had. He then flashed a pink card at her. The card had the w ords "Tanglin Police" on it. The Accused told her he w orked in a police 


station and that he suspected that she had stolen things from the 7-Eleven shop. He then pulled her by the arm as he w alked aw ay from the shop. She tried to push his hand aw ay but he only held her arm more tightly. She follow ed the Accused as she w as afraid of being harmed by him. 

10     The Accused brought her to Block 183, w hich w as adjacent to Block 190, and they w ent up to a staircase landing on the third floor w here the Accused told her to sit dow n on the stairs. He then began to smoke a cigarette and to drink a can of beer. He questioned her on w hether she had consumed drugs. When she said she had not, the Accused put his hand into the pockets of her Bermuda shorts to search. He then pulled her arm and asked her to lie dow n on the landing. She w as afraid of being harmed by him and therefore did as instructed. 

11     The Accused proceeded to remove all the clothing of the Complainant, w arning her not to shout or else suffer a beating. He then stripped off his clothes and lay on top of her, fondling her breasts, her vagina, sucking her nipples and kissing her neck. He then inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt a sharp pain and w anted to cry but did not dare do so for fear that he w ould assault her. 

12     After gratifying himself, he told her to dress up and to go up the stairs to the highest floor and remain there. She complied. He did not follow her up. 

13     After remaining at the fourth floor for some 45 minutes, the Complainant decided to leave for home. She w ent dow n the stairs and w alked tow ards Lorong 7 Toa Payoh. 

14     As she w as w alking along Lorong 7 near the market, the Accused saw her and shouted at her. She w as afraid to see him after the first encounter. Although there w ere some other male Indians at the market, she did not call for help as they had been talking to the Accused and appeared to be his friends. He w alked tow ards her and pulled her by the arm again, mumbling something w hich she did not comprehend. He brought her to Block 17A w hich housed a bank and w here there w as a spiral staircase, pushing her into the corner w here the underside of the spiral staircase met the ground. She therefore had to sit on the floor. 

15     The Accused lit a cigarette and smoked. After that, he stripped the Complainant w ho did not dare to resist as he w as staring at her fiercely. He then took off his clothes and sat dow n beside her. He low ered her body to the floor, w ent on top of her and began to fondle her body. He tried to kiss her on the mouth but she refused to open it. He then used his hand to try to force her mouth open and tried to kiss her. He stopped after a w hile and inserted his penis into her vagina for the second time, pushing forcefully and causing her immense pain. She tried to push him aw ay w ith both her hands but he held them to the floor. 

16     The Accused then stopped and pulled the Complainant’s left hand to hold his penis and her right hand to hug him. They lay like that for about half an hour, w ith him holding on to her right hand. When she saw that he w as asleep, she tried to release her numb left hand from his penis but the movement roused the Accused. He started to kiss and fondle her body again. 

17     He then caused her to sit up and spread her legs apart and he sat facing her w ith his legs resting on her thighs. He held his penis w ith one hand and used the other to push her head forcefully tow ards his penis. She refused to open her mouth but he used his hand to force her to open it. He then inserted his penis into her mouth and pushed her head up and dow n w ith such force that she could hardly breathe. 

18     After ten minutes or so of fellatio, the Accused released the Complainant w ho w as panting by then. Before she could catch her breath, he forced her head dow n to his penis again. This time, she kept her mouth shut but he continued to rub his penis against her mouth. 

19     After that, he stopped and caressed her vagina. He then told her to get dressed. While she w as putting on her clothes, he asked her w hether she w anted some coffee. When she said she w ould like some, he told her to w ait there for him w hile he w ent to bring the coffee. 


20     When the Complainant saw the Accused w as a distance aw ay, she fled in a panic, afraid that he might turn around at anytime. She ran tow ards Block 17 until she reached Lorong 6 w here she managed to flag a taxi w hich brought her to her home in Lorong 8. As she did not have money to pay the fare, she told the taxi driver to w ait w hile she w ent up to her flat to get some money. In her flat, she took $5 from the altar table and then w ent back dow n to pay the fare. 

21     After doing that, she w ent up to her flat and lay on the sofa in the living room. Her father w oke up and asked her w hy she had returned home so late. She did not reply and w anted to cry. Her father noticed that her face w as pale, her hair w as messy, her arms, her face and her t-shirt w ere dirty and enquired further. She then revealed to him that she had been raped by an unknow n Indian w hile w alking home. Her father then w ent to w ake her mother up and together they proceeded to Kim Keat Neighbourhood Police Post to lodge a report. It w as past 5 am then. 

22     At the NPP, Sgt Lim Chee Peng interview ed the Complainant’s father and w as informed by him that the Complainant had been raped by an unknow n male Indian on tw o occasions, the first having taken place at about 2 am at the staircase landing of Block 190 near the 7-Eleven shop and the second at Block 17A. When I asked the Complainant’s father w hy he had told the police officer that the first rape w as at Block 190, he denied that he had mentioned the block number. He testified that he w as not very familiar w ith the block numbers although he lived in Toa Payoh and had merely told the police officer that the Complainant w as dragged to a place somew here in Toa Payoh Central. 

23     The Complainant and her parents w ere referred thereafter to Tanglin Police Division HQ. 

24     At 9.10 am on 4 June 1999, the Complainant w as examined by Dr Kenneth Edw ard Lee at KK Women’s & Children’s Hospital. In his report, he said: 

## "Her history was vague. 

## She was allegedly taken to a block of flats by an Indian male and was forced to 

## perform oral sex on him. There was also penile-vaginal penetration and anal sex. 

## She was unsure if there was ejaculation. 

## She was then released and left alone. However, she encountered the same man 

## on her way home and was forced to have sex with him again. She was uncertain 

## if there was ejaculation. 

## Physical examination was as follows: 

## She was anxious, slightly distressed and appeared dazed. She was in a blue t

## shirt and shorts with unkempt hair. There was no evidence of alcohol or drug 

## usage". 

The doctor also found a superficial abrasion on the left corner on the left corner of her mouth and dirt marks on the soles of her feet, her back and her thighs. There w as a fresh tear of the hymen w ith slight bleeding. There w ere no bruises. 

25     Asked in cross-examination by the Accused w hether he had beaten her up at any time, the Complainant replied that he did. She did not think it w as necessary to mention this in her statement. Later, she explained that he had asked her to shut up, beating her face once lightly as a threat, during the second incident of rape. She affirmed that he had not asked for her consent to engage in sex w ith her and that she had not given such consent at any time. 

26     Asked by the Accused how he could have pulled her along outside the 7-Eleven shop w hen there w ere 


residents around, the Complainant replied that it w as already past midnight then and nobody w as around. Similarly the residents living in the flats overlooking that area did not see this happening as they must have gone to bed since their flats w ere dark. She did not scream as she w as very afraid of the Accused w ho w as holding on to her arm tightly. 

27     Before the second incident at Block 17A, w hen they w ere along Lorong 7, she also did not scream for help as she w as fearful. This w as despite the fact that the Accused w as about ten steps aw ay from her w hen she saw him and inspite of the fact that that w as an open space. 

28     SSG Png Chen Chen w as the Investigating Officer in charge of this case. At about 4.30 pm on 4 June 1999, she w ent w ith tw o other police officers and the Complainant to the scenes at Block 183 and Block 17A. Nothing w as found at the staircase landing on the third floor of Block 183. At Block 17A, beneath the spiral staircase, they found a torn-off piece of new spaper, some strands of hair and a cigarette butt. There w ere blood stains on the floor and blood sw abs w ere taken. 

29     The Complainant’s outer and inner clothing w ere seized by the Investigating Officer as exhibits. 

30     The circumstances leading to the arrest of the Accused w ere as follow s. From the lead given by the Complainant that she had seen a pink card w ith the w ords "Tanglin Police Station" flashed by the Accused, the Investigating Officer believed the card w as a Urine Test Reporting Card issued by the Central Narcotics Bu re a u ("CNB"). She sought the assistance of CNB (Tanglin) to provide information on male Indian supervisees, giving them the description of the suspect. When the photographs of the said supervisees w ere ready, the Complainant w as asked to go and view them. She picked out one of the photographs. 

31     From the particulars of that suspect provided by the CNB (Tanglin), the Investigating Officer led a team of police officers to the Accused’s address on 1 September 1999. When they arrived at the carpark of the Accused’s block of flats at Block 17, Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, they saw him seated nearby. They checked the Accused and seized the pink CNB supervision card from his person. They then placed him under arrest and brought him up to his flat w here five items of his clothing w ere seized. 

32     They brought the Accused to CNB (Tanglin) and then to Criminal Investigation Department. Later that day, the same team escorted the Accused to view the scenes at Block 183 and Block 17A. 

33     On 2 September 1999, the Investigating Officer charged the Accused w ith the First Charge and proceeded to record a statement from him pursuant to Section 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code after having administered the Notice of W arning provided in that section. The Accused, speaking in English, said: 

## "I have nothing to say for I am not guilty. I wish to explain everything to your 

## majesty." 

34     On 6 September 1999, the Accused w as brought to the Department of Scientific Services w here a blood sample w as taken from him for the purpose of DNA testing. 

35     On 7 September 1999, the Investigating Officer charged the Accused w ith the other six Charges and proceeded to record his statements in respect of each of the Charges. In each case, the Accused responded w ith w ords to the effect that he w ished to explain everything in Court and to prove his innocence w hen he w ould be having legal counsel. At the trial, the Accused agreed that all the seven statements taken from him had been made by him voluntarily. 

36     On 9 September 1999, the Accused w as sent to Changi Prison Hospital for a Potency Test. Dr Leow Kee Fong examined him and reported that there w as no indication of impotence and that the results of investigation for sexually transmitted diseases w ere negative. 

37     That afternoon, the Accused w as brought to Jurong Police Division HQ for an Identification Parade to be 


held. The Complainant managed to identify the Accused out of a total of nine persons participating in the parade. 

38     The report from Mrs Tan Wai Fun, Scientific Officer at the Department of Scientific Services show ed that the saliva found on the cigarette butt located at Block 17A w as in all probability the Accused’s. The semen stains on the Complainant’s shorts and panties and the semen found in the vaginal and anal sw abs taken from the Complainant w ere likew ise all found to have come from the Accused. 

### THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE 

39     When the Accused w as called upon to make his defence to the seven Charges, he elected to testify as a w itness. He called no one else in his defence. He w as educated up to Primary 6 in the English stream. Before his arrest, he w orked as a labourer in the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore. 

40     On 3 June 1999 before midnight, the Accused returned to Toa Payoh after visiting a friend in Bishan. He w ent to the 7-Eleven shop at Block 190 Toa Payoh to buy a can of beer. He then sat outside the shop. There w ere a few men in the vicinity. 

41     About half an hour later, he saw the Complainant w alking out of the shop and w alking aw ay from w here he w as. He decided to w alk home and happened to be going along the same w ay as the Complainant. 

42     When the Accused caught up w ith the Complainant, he spoke in a friendly manner to her. She appeared shocked and started to edge closer to the w all. He asked her w hy she w as afraid of him but she merely mumbled something. He asked her w hether she w as going home but again she said something unintelligible and looked afraid. The Accused then asked her w hy she w as afraid and w hether she had stolen the packet of drink from the shop. The Complainant appeared more shocked and edged all the w ay next to the w all. 

43     Not know ing w hat she w as afraid of, w ith the can of beer and a cigarette in one hand, the Accused took out his CNB supervision card and told her that he w as "no police" and gave her the card to read. He took the card back after she had read it. 

44     They kept w alking. The Complainant smiled after he asked her w hether she w as going home. He could not have forced her or pulled her along as there w ere people in the vicinity. 

45     When they reached a staircase at Block 183, the Accused asked the Complainant to go up the staircase and she w ent up w ith him voluntarily. They sat at the landing on the second floor w here he asked her w hether she w anted to drink or to eat anything. She said, "No". He also asked her w hether she w anted to smoke but again she said, "No". He then asked her w hether she had money but she kept quiet. He repeated the question but she maintained her silence. 

46     The Accused then placed his hands inside both pockets of the Complainant’s Bermuda shorts to see w hether there w as money in any of them. She did not resist or do anything. As they w ere right outside tw o flats, if she had made any sound, the residents therein w ould certainly have heard her. 

47     He then asked her to go up another floor w ith him. When they had done so, he put his arm around her and caressed her. She still did not resist. He then asked her to lie dow n. They removed their clothes and had sexual intercourse there. 

48     When they w ere done, he told her to dress up and asked her w hether she w anted a drink. She merely kept quiet and stood at the landing. He then told her that he w as going home and w hen there w as still no response from her, he left. 


49     He w ent to the market at Block 18 and had a drink w ith a friend there. There w ere some men at the stall. After about 45 minutes, he decided to w alk back to his flat w hich w as in a block next to the market. That w as w hen he saw the Complainant again. She w as about ten steps ahead of him w hen she turned around and saw him. It w as an open area at the roadside. 

50     The Accused w alked up to her and asked her w hat she w as doing there. She stood there w ithout responding. After getting no reply w hen he asked her w hether she w as going home, he told her, "Come" and she follow ed him to Block 17A. 

51     They had sexual intercourse again below the spiral staircase. She did not refuse him or do anything at all. He did not threaten her. It w as nearly morning by then. If people passed by that spot, they w ould have seen both of them. Similarly, if she had screamed, people w ould have heard her. 

52     They remained there until nearly 6 am w hen he asked her to dress up and asked her w hether she w anted breakfast. She said she w anted to have coffee. He w ent out from that place to buy coffee but w hen he returned, she w as no longer there. W hen he could not find her, he w ent home. 

53     Asked in cross-examination w hy he had stopped the Complainant outside the 7-Eleven shop, the Accused replied that sometimes he w ould approach w omen to make friends. He show ed her the CNB supervision card because a drug supervisee could not be a policeman or some person of authority. He put his hands into her pockets to check w hether she had money as she could be shy and did not w ant to ask him for money. In doing so, he did touch her thighs. 

54     At the staircase landing of Block 183, the Accused removed the Complainant’s upper clothes. He then asked her to take off her Bermuda shorts and she did so. He then stripped himself and removed the Complainant’s panties after w hich they had sex. Throughout the w hole episode, the Complainant remained quiet. He did not ask her w hether she w anted to have sex. He deduced from her compliant conduct w hen he asked her to go up the stairs and from her silence and lack of resistance that she w as agreeable to the sexual encounter. He did not have to offer her any money or otherw ise persuade her to agree. He w as not really surprised by all this as he had gone "to the fullest" w ith some w omen on the first date. 

55     On both occasions, the Complainant follow ed him w hen he asked her to. He did not pull her arms or otherw ise coerce her to follow him. He could not have dared to do that as they w ere in open spaces and on a road. There w as also a night market there and people knew him as he had been living in Toa Payoh for 30 years. Asked w hether there w as anybody around at that time, i.e. past 2 am, the Accused said a man rode by on a bicycle. 

56     The Accused then elaborated on the events below the spiral staircase at Block 17A. When they arrived at that spot, they sat dow n on the floor and he smoked a cigarette. After that, he asked her to remove her clothes and she did so. He then took off his clothes and asked her to lie dow n and spread her legs apart. They then had sexual intercourse. There w as no reaction from the Complainant. She did not try to push him aw ay. He did not kiss her on the mouth because he had a cut on his upper lip. 

57     He did not say much to her. He did ask her w here she lived and she merely said "234". She either mumbled or did not respond to his queries about w hy she w as not back home and w hether she had any problem. 

58     After they had sexual intercourse, they rested. He did not place her left hand to hold his penis. Instead, he placed her left hand on top of his stomach. He then fell asleep. 

59     When he aw oke, he tried to move her head tow ards his penis but she resisted. When he tried a second time, she resisted again. His penis touched her mouth for a few seconds, but she refused to open it. He 


gave up after that. He did not force her head tow ards his penis and neither did he insert it into her mouth. He did not slap her face. He guessed that the Complainant did not like fellatio. She did not say anything w hen he tried asking her to perform fellatio but she did look rather angry. 

60     Asked w hy he chose not to explain all this in his statements w hen invited by the Investigating Officer to do so, the Accused said he thought it w ould be better to give his statement to his law yer. 

61     In response to the Court’s questions, the Accused said he thought of becoming friends w ith the Complainant but did not ask for her name nor introduce himself. 

### THE DECISION OF THE COURT 

62     The Complainant w as visibly slow mentally but could respond calmly and clearly to questions in Court. She spoke slow ly but certainly not in a manner w hich suggested that she w as concocting a story. 

63     I found her account coherent and truthful even if her habit of travelling to tow n for meals and w alking the many kilometres home w ould seem somew hat bizarre to a person of average intellect and means. How ever, the evidence show ed clearly that she w as, unfortunately, not a normal person. 

64     Tw o seemingly unsatisfactory aspects of her testimony must be addressed – her affirmative response to the Accused’s question w hether he had beaten her up and her account to Dr Kenneth Edw ard Lee that there w as anal sex. In her statements, she had made no mention of any beating. She explained that the slap during the second encounter w ith the Accused w as a light one, interpreted by her to be a w arning to her to keep quiet and that she did not think it w as necessary to state it. I believed her. The slap w as mentioned by her only because of a direct question by the Accused. She had not sought to exaggerate the force or the number of times. I did not think it affected her credibility in any w ay. 

65     I presumed there w as no anal penetration as no evidence w as adduced from the Complainant about this. When she w as seen by Dr Lee on 4 June 1999 at 9.10 am, she had no, or very little sleep after the eventful early hours of the morning. The doctor noted that "her history w as vague" and that she w as anxious, slightly distressed and appeared dazed. Bearing in mind all the above and the fact that she is of "the borderline range of intelligence", she could have easily made a mistake or miscommunicated to the doctor that there w as anal penetration as w ell. No doubt there w as a discrepancy but it did not materially affect her testimony w hen view ed in its totality. 

66     Whether the Complainant’s father or the Complainant had told the police that the first incident w as at Block 190 (instead of Block 183) or w hether the police officer at the NPP had made an error w as irrelevant in the light of the Accused’s admission that such an incident did take place and that the venue w as at a staircase landing in Block 183. In any event, Block 190 did feature prominently as that w as w here the 7Eleven shop w as located. 

67     The Complainant’s father’s evidence supported the Complainant’s testimony that the sexual encounters w ere entirely against her w ill. She returned home looking pale, dishevelled and dirty. That certainly did not sound like someone w ho had had consensual sex, w ho w ould certainly have taken a few minutes to at least tidy up. Further, it w ould be very strange indeed for the Complainant to decide to take a taxi w hen she w as so close to home after having w alked all the w ay back from Orchard Road, and then from Block 

183\. Clearly she did not have the money for the fare. Why did the Accused, so concerned about w hether she needed money but w as too shy to ask, not give her even a couple of dollars after rummaging in her pockets? 

68     On the other hand, the Accused’s version of events over-stretched the bounds of credibility. It w as unbelievable that a girl w ho w as so shocked and afraid of someone coming up to her to strike a 


conversation that she had to sidle tow ards a w all w ould go up to a staircase landing w ith the same stranger, allow him to grope about in her shorts pockets and to fondle her, remove her clothes w hen asked to and then "go the fullest" (to borrow the Accused’s w ords). This w as even more unbelievable w hen she w as merely muttering unintelligibly or keeping silent most of the time. It w as also incredible that the Accused’s "introduction" of himself to a female stranger w as to prove that he w as a drug supervisee. The scenario fitted so much more logically w ith the Complainant’s version. 

69     After having such intimacy w ith the Complainant, it w ould be highly unusual for the Accused to w alk aw ay w ithout even asking for her name or her contact number. Her evidence that she w as told to go up to the highest floor and that she remained there for about 45 minutes coincided w ith the period that the Accused said he w as drinking w ith his friend at the market. 

70     The same comments applied to the second encounter. 

71     It w as true that everything happened in a densely populated housing estate and that help w ould probably have come if the Complainant had only screamed and tried to fight off the Accused. It w as, how ever, the small hours of the morning. People w ere already in bed and not looking out their w indow s nor going about their daily activities. More importantly, the Accused, w ho appeared to me to be quite clever de spite his lack of formal education, w ould have noticed, w ithin a very short span of time, that the Complainant w as a simpleton of sorts and could be easily bullied and cow ed into submission. That w as w hy he dared to accost and pull her by her arm even in an open space, to reach into her pockets to molest her in front of flats and to calmly finish his beer and cigarette before violating the most intimate part of the Complainant’s body. 

72     Why did she not seek help from the people in the flats at Block 183 after the first encounter? Why did she not take a taxi home like she did after the second encounter? These rhetorical questions w ere raised by the Accused in his closing submissions. The answ er w as, simply, the slow intellect of the Complainant. Quite obviously, she did not behave as average adults her age w ould do. After the second unfortunate encounter, surely even a dullard like her could sense the importance of getting home quickly and out of danger. Her initial reactions might not have been normal but I found them entirely understandable in the circumstances of her case. 

73     What w as most telling about the Accused’s unbelievable testimony w as the fact that he had chosen not to even w hisper the defence of consent w hen invited to state his response to the Charges on 2 September 1999 and on 7 September 1999, although he maintained his innocence. Why w ould a man w ho had had consensual sex w ith a girl but w ho had been accused of rape and molest not w ant to disclose this complete defence to regain his freedom? The Accused could offer only the feeble reason that he preferred to say all this to his law yer. I could see no logic at all in this. I therefore drew adverse inferences against his failure to state this defence in any of his statements. 

74     On the totality of the evidence, I had no doubt w hatsoever that the Complainant’s version w as the truth. The Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused on each of the seven Charges. 

### SENTENCE 

75     The Accused w as convicted under Section 380 Penal Code in 1978 and more recently, under Section 8(a) Misuse of Drugs Act for possession of drug in September 1997. He w as sentenced to undergo reformative training the first time and imprisonment of 18 months for the second conviction. 

76     The Prosecution sought a deterrent sentence on the grounds that the Accused had taken advantage of a mentally slow victim, had committed repeated rape w ith threats and had subjected the victim to sexual 


indignities and perversions, that the victim had been adversely affected in that she w as no longer as cheerful as before and w as now afraid to go out by herself. I w as also told that there w as a general upw ard trend in the number of rapes reported over the last four years. Various sentencing precedents w ere also cited for my guidance. 

77     Before sentencing the Accused, I made the follow ing remarks at the close of the trial: 

## "1 Clearly, the Accused has committed dastardly acts against an innocent girl 

## whose fear and mental capabilities did not allow her to fight back or to scream 

## for assistance. On that fateful morning, violating her body at the staircase 

## landing was no satiation for him. He accosted the unfortunate victim a second 

## time when she was making her way home after having suffered the indignity of 

## being raped in the housing estate in which she lived. Obviously, he dared to do 

## this as he had been emboldened by this seemingly simple prey who was visibly 

## slow in intellect. 

## 2 Predators like the present Accused who attack vulnerable females in this 

## horrific manner must be locked up for a long, long time to keep our housing 

## estates and our streets safe by day or by night. 

## 3 The Accused is accordingly sentenced as follows: 

## 1 st Charge : 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the 

## cane. 

## 2 nd Charge : 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the 

## cane. 

## 3 rd Charge : 6 months imprisonment. 

## 4 th Charge : 6 months imprisonment. 

## 5 th Charge : 9 months imprisonment. 

## 6 th Charge : Minimum of 2 years imprisonment and 6 strokes 

## of the cane. 

## 7 th Charge : 5 years imprisonment. 

## The imprisonment terms for the 1st, 2nd and 7th Charges are to run consecutively. The other 

## imprisonment sentences will run concurrently with those three. The Accused is therefore sentenced 

## to a total of 25 years imprisonment with effect from 1 September 1999 and to suffer the maximum 

## number of strokes mandated by law, i.e. 24 strokes of the cane."
