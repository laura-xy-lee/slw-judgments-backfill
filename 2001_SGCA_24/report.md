## JUDGMENT (on costs): 

**_Cur Adv Vult_** 

1\. On 30 March 2001, we handed down our judgment in this appeal, in which we dismissed the appeal and reserved the 

question of costs for consideration after hearing arguments from the parties. We have since then had the benefit of considering 

the written submissions of counsel on the question. 

2\. Four main issues were raised by the parties in this appeal. In the court below, AXA raised a further issue of illegality on 

which the judge decided against them, and they had not appealed against that part of her judgment. In respect of that issue, she 

awarded the costs to Everbright. That order as to costs stands, and will not be affected by the order we now make. 

3\. The four main issues raised before us were also raised below. Of these, a very important issue was whether the Sirena 1 

being a chartered vessel fell within the held covered clause in the ICC. Substantial arguments were devoted to and a 

considerable amount of time was taken up on this issue, both here and below, and on this issue Everbright succeeded. In view 

of this, the general rule that costs follow the event should not apply, and AXA should be deprived of a part of the costs, to 

which they would otherwise be entitled. 

4\. In the circumstances, AXA should have only 2/3 of the costs here and below. We accordingly so order. We reiterate that 

the order below awarding to Everbright the costs for the issue of illegality raised by AXA is to remain undisturbed. We make the 

usual consequential order directing the payment to AXA or their solicitors of the security deposit in court, with interest, if any, 

to account of their costs.
