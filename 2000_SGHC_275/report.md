JUDGMENT: Grounds of Dec ision The c laim 1. The "KAY" was arrested in this ac tion by her c rew on 18 November 1998. It was sold for $1,620,000 inc luding bunkers on board. After payment of the Sheriff’s expenses, c rew’s wages and the c laims by the shipyard there remained to the ac c ount of the ac tion about $570,000. Two parties are sc rambling for it. 2. By Notic e of Motion No 250 of 1999 a Liberian Corporation have asked for the funds in Court to be paid out to them. By name it is Falkland Investments Ltd ("Falkland"). A Russian c orporation Vladivostoc k Base of Trawling and Refrigeratory Fleet ("VBTRF") by its liquidator opposes the applic ation. 3. Falkland asserts the c laim for the funds on the premises that it was the owner of the "KAY" at the time of the arrest and sale. The determination of the issues depends on whether the premises put forward by Falkland are true or false. So I shall at onc e state the premises relied on by Falkland. The premises 4. Falkland’s basic premises is that the former owner of the "KAY", that is VBTRF, by an agreement dated 16 January 1998 transferred the vessel to Falkland as datio in solutum. The Latin phrase means "An ac c ord and satisfac tion under the c ivil law, wherein the c onsideration is in property and not in money". The doc ument states "indemnity" as the equivalent of datio in solutum. The vessel was then known as "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" and belonged to the Port of Vladivostoc k. 5. Following the transfer, says Falkland, the vessel was on 1 July 1998 registered provisionally at the Port of Belize in the state of Belize. It is in Central Americ a. It was formerly known as British Honduras. The provisional registration c ertific ate was issued on 1 July 1998. 6. The transfer doc ument refers to Falkland as "Creditor" and VBTRF as the "Debtor". The rec itals in the transfer doc ument read as follows : "(1) The debtor and the Creditor on 2 June 1997 c onc luded a Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") under whic h the Debtor rec eived a loan in the amount of USD7,000,000 (seven million) and was to repay same to the Creditor within 11 July 1997 in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the Loan Agreement. (2) The debtor and the Creditor on 2 June 1997 c onc luded a mortgage agreement in respec t of MV "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" and whic h is registered in the State Register of Ships in the Fishing Sea Port of Vladivostoc k No 43 on 3 June 1997 ("the Mortgage Agreement"). (3) The debtor has defaulted in the due performanc e of his obligations under the Loan Agreement, has ac knowledged his debt in full and undertakes in all respec ts to proc ure the repayment of the moneys to the Creditor due under the Loan Agreement but is unable to make any repayments." 7. The operative parts of the doc ument whic h effec ted the transfer of title read as follows : "1.1 In c onsideration of the matters set out in this Agreement the Debtor undertakes in lieu of the partial performanc e of its obligations under the Loan Agreement and the performanc e of its obligations under the Mortgage Agreement to transfer to the Creditor the vessel "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" ("the Vessel") and the Creditor undertakes to ac c ept the said Vessel as an indemnity (datio in solutum) in ac c ordanc e with the present Agreement. 1.2 The Vessel "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" is registered in the State Register of Ships in the Fishing Sea Port of Vladivostoc k 19 July 1990 under No 6. The vessel is sailing under the Russian Flag, has a c all signal UHGP. 1.3 It has been mutually agreed between the Parties that the transfer of the Vessel and the rights of ownership therein to the Creditor shall extinguish the Debtor’s obligation under the Loan Agreement only in the amount of US$3,500,000 (three million, five hundred thousand) and provided always that the transfer of the Vessel is c ompleted and shall extinguish the Debtor’s obligations under the Mortgage Agreement. Save as aforesaid the Debtor’s obligations under the Loan Agreement and all other assoc iated sec urity doc uments shall remain in full forc e and effec t. 2. Transfer of the vessel and Doc uments. 2.1 The vessel shall be transferred in its entirety, inc luding any of its part and appurtenanc e suc h as her engines, equipment, life boats, spare parts and materials, bunkers and other c onsumable as well as non-c onsumable supplies whether on board the vessel or ashore and whether available at the time of the c onc lusion of the present Agreement or ac quired thereafter. 2. Upon signing this Agreement all rights of ownership (title) in the vessel are immediately transferred by 


the Debtor to the Creditor and the Debtor will transfer to the Creditor all the doc uments relating to the vessel and any additional doc uments c onfirming the transfer of the right of ownership (title) therein whic h the Creditor may require. 2.3 The Debtor hereby transfers the vessel and all rights of ownership therein to the Creditor and undertakes to assist the Creditor in c omplying with all legal formalities whic h may be required. 2.4 The Debtor shall transfer to the Creditor all the doc uments relating to the Vessel by no later than c lose of business in London on 28 February 1998 as well as any additional doc uments c onfirming the right of ownership (other than this Agreement) whic h may be required by the Creditor. 2.5 The transfer of the vessel shall take effec t when this Agreement is signed by the parties and shall be deemed finally ac c omplished and the obligations of the Debtor under the Loan Agreement in the respec tive part and under the Mortgage Agreement shall be extinguished, but only to the extent provided by this Agreement." 8. The transfer doc ument provided that it "shall be governed by and c onstrued in ac c ordanc e with English Law". 9. There was an earlier attempt to transfer the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" also by way of datio in solutum by a by a transfer agreement dated 9 September 1997. It was not c onsummated bec ause VBTRF’s inability. Henc e the sec ond transfer agreement. Both transfer agreements were signed for VBTRF by Nikolay Nikitenko. The Mortgage 10. There was inc ontrovertible evidenc e that the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" was mortgaged by VBTRF in favour of Falkland. The mortgage was duly entered in the ship register on 3 June 1997. It was part of a fleet mortgage of seven vessels. The aggregate amount in respec t of all the seven mortgages was USD12m. The amount of USD7,000,000 was transferred on behalf of Falkland by Clydesdale Bank plc (UK) through National Australia Bank Limited. It was transferred to VBTRF’s bank, Darylbank, Vladivostoc k. The value date was 5 June 1997. The arrest in China 11. Falkland c aused the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" to be arrested at the Port of Dalian, China on 30 January 

1998\. The vessel remained under arrest in China till 1 July 1998. On that day at the request of Falkland the vessel was released from arrest. It was on 1 July 1998 that provisional registration of the vessel was effec ted at the Port of Belize. Falkland no longer maintain the arrest sinc e it bec ame the registered owner on 1 July 1998. Its new name was "KAY". The "KAY" c omes to Singapore 12. Falkland engaged c rew for the"KAY" who began their servic e on 1 September 1998. From Dailan the "KAY" sailed into Singapore under the ownership of Falkland. At Singapore, the vessel was plac ed in the hands of Singapore Tec hnologies Marine Ltd ("ST Marine") for repairs. The vessel was brought to Singapore by Lithuanian c rew. Claims against Falkland 13. (i) At Singapore the "KAY" was arrested by its master and c rew in this ac tion. The master filed an affidavit positively asserting that (i) they were engaged by Falkland Investments Ltd, (ii) Falkland was the owner of the "KAY" and (iii) the vessel was registered at the Port of Belize. (ii) Falkland made a substantial payment to ST Marine but not all. ST Marine instituted in rem proc eedings against the "KAY" in Admiralty in Rem No 855 of 1998. Again ST Marine positively asserted that it c ontrac ted with Falkland and filed an affidavit exhibiting invoic es addressed to Falkland. Eventually ST Marine obtained judgment and $553,731.86 was paid out to it. (iii) Bankassure Insuranc e Servic es Ltd and Aon Group Ltd c ommenc ed a personam ac tion against Falkland to rec over premiums payable to them in respec t of c rew liability and port risk insuranc e. They obtained default judgment in Suit No 609 of 1999 against Falkland on 25 May 1999 for USD133,726.04 plus interest and c osts. In respec t of the "KAY" there were 23 debit notes c overing the period beginning 23 January 1998 and ending 4 Dec ember 1998. All debit notes named Falkland as the insured party. Admissions by VBTRF 14. In Korea, Falkland c aused the arrest of two vessels in the ownership of VBTRF. This was on 24 Marc h 1998, that is before the "KAY" was provisionally registered at the Port of Belize. In July and August 1998 they were sold by the Korean Court for an aggregate amount of USD6.7m. Falkland c auses three other vessels belonging to VBTRF to be arrested in Korea. Ac c ording to Falkland two of these three vessels broke arrest and sailed off. Those on board no doubt would have reported to VBTRF about the other VBTRF vessels in Korea. VBTRF disputes that the vessels broke arrest but does not deny that the vessels were in the Korean port and departed from them. Admiralty arrests are unknown in Russia. The third vessel was sold by the Court for USD300,000. It is Falkland’s c ase that moneys c laimed in Korea were in respec t of a different loan transac tion. It was over and above the USD7m in respec t of whic h the "KAY" and another vessel the "VIRGO I" were transferred to Falkland datio in solutum. It was in partial satisfac tion of the US$7m loan that the "KAY" ex "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" was transferred to it – that is US$3,500,000. 15. Now c omes the nub of the matter. VBTRF filed doc uments in Korean Court proc eedings made the following admissionary and assertions : (i) Falkland Investments Ltd loaned VBTRF USD7,000,000 ON 2 June 1997 and USD8,977,601.08 ON 14 July 1997. (ii) On January 6, 1998 VBTRF and Falkland signed a settlement agreement for repayment of the above c redit and debt (namely the USD7m). The c ontent of the settlement was that VBTRF assigned the rights and ownership of vessels owned by VBTRF, the "KAPITAN VOLOSHIN" (the "VIRGO I") and "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" (the "KAY") and as the vessels were valued at USD3,500,000 eac h, the above debt of 


USD7,000,000 was c ompletely repaid. In ac c ordanc e with the above settlement agreement, VBTRF assigned the rights and ownership of the above vessels to Falkland, the above debts was totally repaid. (iii) Additionally, in ac c ordanc e with the performanc e of the above settlement agreement VBTRF’s mortgage has already been c anc elled in Russia. 16. VBTRF is now in liquidation and there are proc eedings in Russia. There too there is a ruling affirming that "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN" (renamed "KAY") and "KAPITAN VOLOSHIN" (renamed "VIRGO I") were transferred to Falkland in satisfac tion the debt of USD7,000,000 due from VBTRF to Falkland. Thus the transfer agreement is rec ognized. 17. The above is an extrac tion of the essential elements Falkland relied on to make out the premises on whic h it founded its c ase. It omits c onsiderable peripheral matters. What I have stated is the sort of evidenc e one wants to see before giving summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules of the Court. There are all inc onvertible fac ts whic h appear in blac k and white. Disc ussion 18. When logic and the law of c ontrac t and evidenc e are applied to the matter I have outlined it leads to the inesc apable c onc lusion that Falkland was the registered owner of the "KAY" from 1 July 1998. The vessel was not taken away from VBTRF by any foul or fraudulent means. It was done with full knowledge of VBTRF. When Falkland took steps to plac e the vessel in the Belize register the Frenc h Classific ation Soc iety, Bureau Veritas notified VBTRF of the c hange of c lass and registry. The Classific ation Soc iety notified VBTRF on 10 September 1998 that "taking into ac c ount c ontent of the Transfer Agreement dated 16 January 1998 and having now rec eived c opy of the International Merc hant Marine Registry of Belize ‘INMARBE" Patent of Navigation, c opy enc losed we c annot anymore delay Classific ation After Construc tion Surveys". The vessel in question was the "VLADIMIR CHIVILIKHIN". VBTRF therefore was fully aware of it rec lassific ation and registration at Belize. Nothing was said to anyone that there was something foul. The c lassific ation soc iety went ahead and rec lassified the vessel. Belize gave it provision registration – provisional bec ause VBTRF failed to sec ure a deletion c ertific ate at the Russian Registry. This was in breac h of the transfer doc ument. Clearly VBTRF was taking advantage of its own wrong. I repeat that the mortgage on the vessel ac c ording to VBTRF was deleted at the Russian Register. 19. VBTRF stood by while the whole world, inc luding Russia, ac ted on the transfer doc ument and subsequent registration in Belize. 20. Several debts were inc urred by Falkland in respec t of whic h admiralty ac tions were filed in Singapore. VBTRF never batted an eyelid against the other c laimants who c ontrac ted with Falkland. It was only when Falkland applied to enter appearanc e and to apply for the balanc e of the proc eeds of the sale that it c ame on the sc ene and made voc iferous objec tions. There was muc h rhetoric on behalf of VBTRF ac c ompanied by voluminous doc uments. There was nothing in them to answer the solid and substantial doc umentary evidenc e plac ed before this Court by Falkland. 21. What emanated from the VBTRF c amp was c onfusion, c ontradic tion, c onfabulation (both c onsc ious and unc onsc ious and obfusc ation). It was a feeble attempt to wrest the fac ts to suit their c laim. There was in fac t a veiled c onc ession that they had no hard evidenc e to produc e. They said that there was some important evidenc e in London. They had been saying that for some time but never c ame up with anything. In view of the glaring admissions VBTRF had made and the long elapse of time sinc e the transfer doc ument I was not c onvinc ed that they c ould produc e anything relevant and c redible. 22. The high water mark of VBTRF’s c ase was that one Oleg Nikitenko was the princ ipal shareholder of Falkland. His father Nikolay Nikitenko was the President of VBTRF, and it was the father who signed the transfer doc ument. It was further said that on 16 January 1996 Nikolay Nikitenko c ould not have signed the transfer and therefore it was a forgery. Finally, it was said, the witness to his signature had no authority. So it was void. I was not persuaded. If it was all right for VBTRF to take a loan from the son’s c ompany and for the father to sign the loan agreement it must be all right for him to sign the settlement and transfer doc ument sinc e he was the President of VBTRF. A witness need not be an employee of the organization on behalf of whic h the doc ument is exec uted. The more important point to note is the admission, relianc e and reaffirmation of VBTRF on the transfer agreement. 23. The c ruc ial point is whether VBTRF rec eived the money. Admittedly it did. There are several obvious and c onspic uous admissions to that effec t in inc ontrovertible doc uments. There was a doc ument evidenc ing the transfer of US$7m to VBTRF. It was said that Falkland was a nett debtor to VBTRF. The Singapore Court, however, is not c onc erned with the global pic ture. The c onc ern of the Singapore Court in this ac tion is the "KAY". So this Court has no jurisdic tion, when disposing of an admiralty c ase to bring into this c ase by a sidewind a myriad of hypothetic al matters unrelated to what is at hand. In good measure, I must rec ord here Falkland has said to this Court that when the balanc e of the proc eeds is rec eived by it, due c redit will be given for it in other proc eedings between it and VBTRF. 24. The true aim of VBTRF’s intervention was to ask this Court to set aside this transfer agreement. To ac hieve that end VBTRF must show that it repaid the loan. Did VBTRF repay? All the evidenc e pointed to the fac t of datio in solutum and not payment by money. Time and again VBTRF asserted and reaffirmed the transfer doc ument and repayment by datio in solutum. It must not resile from it. Ac c ordingly there is not even 


an iota of evidenc e to set aside the transfer agreement. 25. Counsel for Falkland put it poignantly that sinc e the loan and mortgage are not disputed Fakland must be entitled to payment of the balanc e of the proc eeds in that right. But VBTRF has admitted, first in writing that on the basis of the transfer datio in solutum dated 16 January 1997 and that the mortgage registrations at the Russian registry of ship was c anc elled on that basis. Sec ondly, VBTRF never took any steps to prevent the registration of the vessel at the Port of Belize. Thirdly, VBTRF did nothing while the vessel was under arrest in China. Fourthly, VBTRF did nothing in Singapore while ac tions were being filed and judgments being entered; for that matter VBTRF did not objec t to the money being paid out to the c rew and ST Marine. Fifthly, VBTRF has not brought any ac tion against Falkland for stealthily taking the ship away from VBTRF. Sixthly, VBTRF has not produc ed a shade of direc t evidenc e to establish repayment of the loan of USD7m other than by datio in solutum. Having slumbered all this time how c an it now c ome and deny, after all those events, that Falkland is the owner of the "KAY". All that VBTRF has done is to obfusc ate and c onfuse the real issue by bringing in irrelevant and inadmissible materials suc h as the additional loans whic h are the subjec t matter of legal proc eedings elsewhere. I agree. The result 

26\. That c ompels me to c onc lude at onc e with moral c ertainty that Falkland established its entitlement to the balanc e of the proc eeds of the sale of the "KAY". G P Selvam Judge     C opyright © Government of Singapore.
