**Lai Siu Chiu J:** 

1       Chokkanathan Palanimuthu and Chokkanathan Sudha (“the first and sec ond plaintiffs” respec tively) sued V Jayaram and his wife Mohanarani d/o Muthu (“the first and sec ond defendants” respec t ively) _inter alia_ for spec ific performanc e of a c ontrac t of sale of a 4-room Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat situated at Bloc k 193, Riverdale Drive #04-787, Singapore 540193 (“the flat”) and for leave to issue a writ of possession in the event the defendants failed to vac ate the flat upon c ompletion of the sale and purc hase. 

2       After hearing arguments from c ounsel for both parties on the plaintiffs’ applic ation for summary judgment, I granted the plaintiffs’ applic ation and made c onsequential orders. The defendants are dissatisfied with my dec ision and have filed a notic e of appeal (in Civil Appeal No 47 of 2011) against the same. I now give the reasons therefor. 

**The background** 

3       The proc eedings herein started life as Originating Summons No 228 of 2010 (“the OS”). After the attorney of the plaintiffs, one Chinnadurai Sudhakar (“Sudhakar”), had filed an affidavit on their behalf in support of the OS followed by an affidavit from the sec ond defendant and one from the first plaintiff, the OS was c onverted to a suit (Suit No 519 of 2010) bec ause the issues were highly c ontentious. 

4       Thereafter pleadings were filed by the parties. It was only after the plaintiffs had filed a reply to the defendants’ defenc e that the former applied for summary judgment against the defendants. As the pleadings mirror the affidavits filed by the parties, I shall only refer to the latter doc uments in my grounds. Five affidavits were filed altogether, three by Sudhakar, one by the first plaintiff and one by the sec ond defendant on the defendants’ behalf. 

**The facts** 

5       In his affidavit, the first plaintiff deposed that together with his attorney Sudhakar (who is also his relative), he went to view the flat on 31 May 2009. There, they met the sec ond defendant and the defendants’ agent Arnagirenathan (“Arna”) an assoc iate with ERA Real Estate, who was also 


known to the defendants as Steve Nathan, as well as the plaintiffs’ agent P Kalaiman (“Kalai”). The first plaintiff and Sudhakar were told by the sec ond defendant that the first defendant was at work. 

6       After viewing, the first plaintiff offered $290,000 for the flat whic h pric e inc luded $5,000 being what is c ommonly desc ribed as a c ash-over-valuation (“COV”) premium. The sec ond defendant went into a room to c all the first defendant and returned later to inform the foursome that the defendants ac c epted the plaintiff’s offer. Arna then filled up an option to purc hase (“the Option”) whic h had been pre-signed by the defendants and handed it to the first plaintiff. In exc hange, the first plaintiff gave $1,000 c ash to Kalai who then issued a c heque for $1,000 in favour of the first defendant. The c heque was c leared on 2 June 2009. Arna had obtained a valuation report of the flat dated 14 May 2009 whic h stated that the flat was valued at $285,000 as of 8 May 2009 for purposes of obtaining a mortgage loan and for withdrawal of Central Provident Fund monies to purc hase the flat. 

7       Under c l 5 of the Option, the plaintiffs had to pay $4,000 to exerc ise the Option whic h expiry date was 14 June 2009. The plaintiffs applied to borrow $256,500 (“the loan”) from DBS Bank to pay for their purc hase whic h loan was subsequently approved by a letter dated 5 June 2009 from DBS Bank. 

8       On 13 June 2009, the plaintiffs exerc ised the Option by paying $4,000 c ash through Kalai to Arna. In turn, Arna paid the defendants the sum less $80 registration fee to HDB. He deposited $3, into the POSB Bank savings ac c ount of the first defendant, whic h partic ulars had previously been given to him by a text message from the defendants’ son. Evidenc e of the payment was exhibited in the first plaintiff’s affidavit. 

9       As was the usual prac tic e for the sale of HDB flats, the HDB notified the parties by a letter dated 30 July 2009 of a first appointment at HDB on 16 November 2009 (“the first appointment”). The defendants and Sudhakar attended the first appointment where a resale offic er one Quah Kheng Wah (“Quah”) attended to them and explained the resale proc edures and what was required of the respec tive parties in order to c omplete the sale and purc hase. At the request of the defendants, the first appointment was postponed by a week to 23 November 2009. The defendants also requested an extension of 90 days to look for an alternative flat. After c onsulting the first plaintiff on the telephone, Sudhakar ac c eded to the defendants’ request. The defendants then signed, in Quah’s presenc e, a letter of indemnity where it was stated that the defendants would have 90 days’ extension from the date of resale c ompletion (inc orrec tly stated as 16 January 2009) to reside at the flat without rental payment. 

10     On 23 November 2009, the defendants again attended before Quah and signed the HDB form c onfirming that Quah had indeed explained the resale proc edures and requirements to them. The defendants also signed a letter of Undertaking and Ac knowledgment that they had rec eived $5, deposit on the dec lared resale pric e of $290,000. Quah fixed c ompletion of the sale and purc hase on 18 January 2010. 

11     By a letter dated 3 Dec ember 2009, the HDB notified the plaintiffs and the defendants that the sale and purc hase transac tion was approved in princ iple and c onfirmed that c ompletion was tentatively fixed for 18 January 2010. 

12     The sale and purc hase was not c ompleted on 18 January 2010 or at all. The defendants apparently wrote to the HDB on 21 Dec ember 2009 stating they wished to c anc el the resale transac tion due to “the agent’s influenc ing, misguided and misrepresented we are now not able to get a 3-room flat in Ang Mo Kio or elsewhere”. 


 (a) 

 (b) 

13     The plaintiffs then rec eived a letter dated 5 January 2010 (not produc ed in c ourt) from the HDB stating that the defendants did not wish to proc eed with the transac tion. In response, the plaintiffs’ solic itors wrote to the defendants on 14 January 2010 reminding them that c ompletion was fixed on 18 January 2010 and that the plaintiffs reserved their rights if the defendants did not c omplete the matter. 

14     On 1 Dec ember 2009, the plaintiffs was addressed a letter at the flat from ERA Real Estate (“ERA”) headed Sec ond Reminder stating that their invoic e dated 15 September 2009 in the sum of $3,103 was still outstanding. The first plaintiff denied ERA was the plaintiffs’ agent and lodged a polic e report when he c ame to know of their letter. The defendants subsequently relied on ERA’s letter in their defenc e to c ontend that the same agent ac ted for them as well as for the plaintiffs and there was therefore a c onflic t of interest. 

15     It appeared from the doc uments before the c ourt that the sec ond defendant had met ERA sometime in Dec ember 2009 to lodge a c omplaint against Arna. After ERA had c onduc ted its investigations, the c ompany wrote to the sec ond defendant on 6 January 2010 giving Arna’s response on her c omplaints. I shall return to ERA’s letter when I deal with the sec ond defendant’s affidavit (see [19] below). 

16     Notwithstanding the plaintiffs’ solic itors’ letter in [13], the defendants did not c omplete their sale. The OS was issued by the plaintiffs on 1 Marc h 2010, after the plaintiffs’ solic itors had written to the sec ond defendant (as well as to the HDB) on 19 January 2010 giving the requisite 21 days’ notic e under c l 29 of the Law Soc iety’s Conditions of Sale 1999, stating that the plaintiffs were ready, able and willing to c omplete. The 21 days’ notic e expired with no response from either defendant. 

17     The sec ond defendant filed an affidavit to resist the OS whic h c ontained the exac t same reliefs prayed for in the Order 14 applic ation. In her affidavit (whic h will be dealt with in greater detail below a t [19], the sec ond defendant raised various allegations against Arna and the plaintiffs’ agent Kalai. This prompted the plaintiffs’ solic itors to write on 2 June 2010 to ERA Real Estate. The plaintiffs’ solic itors in partic ular sought Arna’s: (a) response to the sec ond defendant’s allegations that he (Arna) did not represent the defendants in the sale and (b) c onfirmation that the plaintiffs were represented at all times by Kalai who was/is from the Dennis Wee Group. Unfortunately, the reply of ERA (if any) was not exhibited by the plaintiffs in any of the affidavits filed on their behalf. Neither was there mention in their affidavits of any response from the Dennis Wee Group. 

18     Notwithstanding the aforesaid missing letter(s), I was still of the view that the defendants had raised no triable issues as to warrant having this c laim tried. 

**The decision** 

19     Earlier (in [15]), I had alluded to the sec ond defendant’s affidavit. She made the following allegations therein: 

 Neither defendant had met or dealt with Sudhakar. 

 Near to midnight on 31 May 2009, their agent Arna c ame to the flat and demanded that she and her husband sign the Option as the plaintiffs were very interested to purc hase and were willing to pay $20,000 over and above the valuation of $285,000. However, as the valuation

 was only $285,000, Arna suggested that he would put the purc hase pric e as $290,000 and the plaintiffs would pay $15,000 “under the table” within 14 days; 

 Arna promised he would find a 3-room flat for them on a “c ontra basis’ immediately after they had sold the flat; 

 The defendants reluc tantly agreed. Arna took down the first defendant’s POSB ac c ount number to deposit the $1,000 deposit paid by the plaintiffs. 

 After 31 May 2009, Arna c ould not be c ontac ted and refused to take the defendants’ c alls when they requested for the $15,000. The defendants then c hec ked with other agents and disc overed that what Arna had promised them was illegal. The defendants refused to proc eed further with the transac tion. In any c ase the plaintiffs had failed to exerc ise the Option in ac c ordanc e with c l 5 therein as they did not deliver the signed Option and Option fee of $4,000 to the defendants before 4pm of 14 June 2009. The defendants had not authorised any third party to rec eive the exerc ised Option or the Option fee of $4,000 nor did they authorise Arna to submit the Option to the HDB. They only knew of the submission from HDB’s letter dated 30 July 2009 giving notic e of the first appointment. 

 The defendants refused to attend the first appointment but Arna threatened that the plaintiffs would sue and lodge a c aveat against the flat whic h meant the defendants would be unable to sell the flat for many years. Arna c aused a c ommotion at the flat and only left when the defendants agreed to attend the first appointment. 

 At the first appointment on 16 November 2009, they informed Quah that they did not trust their agent and did not wish to proc eed with the transac tion and as a result, the appointment was postponed to 23 November 2009. 

 On 23 November 2009, the defendants still refused to go through with the transac tion and they explained to Quah what happened but were pressured by Arna and his supporters that if the defendants failed to sign the doc uments, they would be ruined. 

 Arna had attempted to dec eive them into believing that the defendants were represented by another firm of housing agents. Later, the sec ond defendant disc overed that the same agent represented them as well as the plaintiffs; this was a c lear c onflic t of interest. 

 Subsequently, the defendants attended at the plaintiffs’ solic itors’ offic e to inform the latter that the transac tion was c anc elled; they offered to return the deposit paid to them but the offer was rejec ted. 

20     In essenc e, the defendants made three main allegations: 


 (a) 

 (b) 

 (c ) 

 Arna, their agent, had pressurised them into agreeing to the sale, he was not authorised on their behalf to submit the transac tion to HDB for approval nor to ac c ept the exerc ise of the Option. 

 The transac tion was illegal bec ause it involved “under the table money” that was never rec eived by them. 

 Arna failed to keep his promise to find them a 3-room flat. 

I should point that the allegation regarding “under the table money” was denied by the first plaintiff. 

21     The allegations in (a) and (b) above were not borne out by the defendants’ c onduc t. If indeed, they had been pressurised into the sale, Quah of the HDB would have/should have been told on 16 November 2009. They would not have been asked to sign the Letter of Undertaking and Ac knowledgment if they had not rec eived $5,000 in total from the plaintiffs and the option was not duly exerc ised. Indeed, the defendants should have refused to sign those doc uments if the two allegations were true. More importantly, if indeed the defendants (as the sec ond defendant c laimed) were reluc tant to sell bec ause of Arna’s pressure, why did they request a postponement of the first appointment? Further, why did they sign the letter of indemnity, referred to earlier at [9], in Quah’s presenc e, undertaking to pay all outgoings of the flat in return for the plaintiffs’ agreement to give them an extension of time to vac ate the flat? Suc h c onduc t was wholly inc onsistent with their allegations. 

22     I should add that the defendants’ son had sent the first defendant’s POSB ac c ount partic ulars by short message servic e (“SMS”) to Arna’s handphone on 1 June 2009. Again, suc h c onduc t is inc onsistent with that of reluc tant sellers. 

23     As for allegation (c ) in [20], the c onduc t of the defendants’ agent had nothing to do with the plaintiffs’ and was not relevant to the transac tion. The defendants’ rec ourse was/is against their agent Arna. Even so, this allegation was rebutted by the letter from ERA, referred to earlier at [15], to whic h I now turn my attention. 

24     ERA’s letter of 6 January 2010 revealed that the viewing on 31 May 2009 was the sec ond by the first plaintiff and that his initial offers of $285,000 and $288,000 were rejec ted before the final pric e of $290,000 was ac c epted by the defendants. ERA c onfirmed the fac ts in [6] above. It appeared from their letter that Arna had even obtained interim approval from DBS Bank for the defendants’ loan to purc hase a 3-room flat. Further, Arna had arranged viewings for the defendants of about 8 units of 3-room flats in Ang Mo Kio and Yishun within the defendants’ budget, all of whic h did not meet with their approval. Eventually, the defendants told Arna they would sourc e for the 3room flat themselves to whic h Arna agreed. 

25     In the light of the fac t that the bare allegations in the sec ond defendant’s affidavit were not borne out by the doc uments before the c ourt or were inc onsistent therewith, I saw no reason not to award final judgment to the plaintiffs on their c laim. 

26     In her affidavit, the sec ond defendant had also made a c avalier statement that the plaintiffs, not being resident in Singapore, had no urgenc y to purc hase a flat. In his affidavit, the first plaintiff explained that whilst he was then based in Algeria (as an engineer working for a Singapore public 


c ompany that posted him there), he would need a roof over his/his family’ head when he returned to Singapore after the projec t in Algeria was c ompleted. In any c ase, the foreign posting of the first plaintiff did not afford a valid defenc e to the defendants on the c laim for summary judgment for spec ific performanc e. Ac c ordingly, I granted an order in terms of the plaintiffs’ applic ation.
