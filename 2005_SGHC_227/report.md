**Introduction** 

1       This is a c onstruc tion dispute arising from a subc ontrac t for marine works. The projec t involved the c onstruc tion of a two-storey Polic e Coast Guard SubBase at Loyang Way/Loyang Cresc ent (“the projec t”). The Ministry of Home Affairs (“the employer”) employed Sanc hoon Builders Pte Ltd (“Sanc hoon”), the defendant in this ac tion, as the main c ontrac tor for the projec t. Sanc hoon in turn appointed Lim Chin San Contrac tors Pte Ltd (“LCS Contrac tors”), the plaintiff herein, as its subc ontrac tor for c ertain bored piling and marine works c onnec ted with the projec t. 

2       LCS Contrac tors has two heads of c laim in this c ase. First, it c laims the sum of $444,878.72, being the value of the work that it did for Sanc hoon. Sec ond, it makes a c laim for damages arising from Sanc hoon’s alleged wrongful termination of the subc ontrac t between the parties. Sanc hoon has put in a c ounterc laim in whic h it c laims for damages that it asserts arose from LCS Contrac tors’ alleged repudiation of the subc ontrac t, thereby leading to Sanc hoon’s termination of the same. It c an be seen therefore that the c laim and the c ounterc laim arise out of the same fac ts and whic h one suc c eeds depends on whether I dec ide that Sanc hoon’s termination was wrongful or that it was justified by the c onduc t of LCS Contrac tors. The parties have agreed that this is the main issue to be determined by me and that the issues as to the value of the work done by LCS Contrac tors and the damages suffered by the party who suc c eeds in this c ase should be referred to the Registrar for assessment and determination. 

3       I should point out here, however, that Sanc hoon has by its pleadings admitted that the value of LCS Contrac tors’ work c arried out under the subc ontrac t amounted to $306,912. It is not in dispute that so far Sanc hoon has paid LCS Contrac tors only $87,000 leaving an amount of at least $219,912 due to LCS Contrac tors. If the issues in this ac tion are determined in favour of LCS Contrac tors, then it will be entitled to enter interloc utory judgment for the sum of $219,912. On the other hand, if Sanc hoon is suc c essful in its defenc e, then no judgment c an be entered in favour of LCS Contrac tors until and unless the amount payable by it in damages to Sanc hoon has been asc ertained and been found to be less than $219,912. 


**Background facts** 

4       Part of the works c omprising the projec t involved what were referred to as marine works, _ie_ , the c onstruc tion of a jetty and two piers. These struc tures had to be built over the sea and piles had to be driven into the sea as support for the struc tures. Sanc hoon had no experienc e in this type of work and asked for tenders. LCS Contrac tors was one of the tenderers. It was a c ompany that had muc h experienc e in marine works and its quotation was the most c ompetitive one. The quotations submitted by the other prospec tive subc ontrac tors had been drawn up on the basis that the barge method of piling would be used, _ie_ , that the piles would be driven by a piling rig mounted on a barge. LCS Contrac tors’ tender was, however, based on the earth bund method. This involved the c onstruc tion of a bund into the sea in respec t of eac h of the struc tures to be c onstruc ted. Mac hines and equipment c ould then be driven onto the bund from the shore to c arry out the required works. After the piling works had been c ompleted, the bund would be removed. This was a muc h c heaper way of c arrying out the work as there would be no c osts inc urred for the hire of barges. 

5       The quotation given by LCS Contrac tors was submitted on 27 November 2002. Thereafter, there were at least three meetings between LCS Contrac tors and Sanc hoon to disc uss the projec t and the method for the subc ontrac t works. The third meeting was held on 17 February 2003. Present were Mr Lim Chin Leong, the managing direc tor of LCS Contrac tors; Mr Mic hael Chew, a direc tor of Sanc hoon; and Ms Chew Saw Tin, who was the representative of CPG Consultants Pte Ltd (“CPG”), the struc tural c onsultants for the projec t appointed by the employer. Mr Lim stated that during this meeting, he explained the earth bund method at length and answered queries from Sanc hoon and CPG. 

6       On 25 February 2003, Sanc hoon issued LCS Contrac tors with a letter of intent. This letter c overed two subc ontrac ts that Sanc hoon had indic ated it intended to award to LCS Contrac tors. First, there was the subc ontrac t for the bored piling works valued at $495,156. This subc ontrac t is a separate matter and has no c onnec tion with any of the issues in this ac tion. The sec ond subc ontrac t was that for the c onstruc tion of the wharf and jetty works at an estimated c ontrac t sum of $2,670,561 subjec t to final measurement for provisional items. The letter stated that it was nec essary for the exec ution of the subc ontrac t work to c ommenc e immediately and that LCS Contrac tors should start all nec essary preparation work in antic ipation of the eventual exec ution of a formal subc ontrac t. As it turned out, the ac tual subc ontrac t doc ument was not issued until June 

2003\. It was bac kdated by Sanc hoon to 19 February 2003 but it was ac tually signed by Mr Lim on behalf of LCS Contrac tors on 10 June 2003. 

7       On 24 Marc h 2003, Sanc hoon issued LCS Contrac tors with a doc ument entitled “Marine Works Programme” whic h set out the proposed sc hedule for the works with the various items of work spec ified alongside the intended start and end dates of the same. I shall refer to this doc ument as the “Original Programme” as, in June 2003, Sanc hoon issued a revised Marine Works Programme that made extensive c hanges to the sc heduling. The latter doc ument shall be referred to as the “Revised Programme”. 

8       By the Original Programme, LCS Contrac tors was supposed to provide Sanc hoon with a “Method Statement and Design Calc ulation” (“method statement”) in respec t of the works in Marc h 2003 so that it c ould be approved on 11 April 2003, and to thereafter c ommenc e c onstruc tion of the bund on 4 June 2003. The method statement was only forwarded to Sanc hoon on 16 July 2003. In the meantime, however, LCS Contrac tors had c ommenc ed c onstruc tion of a bund. CPG had a number of questions on the method statement. These were dealt with by LCS Contrac tors’ professional engineer, a firm c alled M/s S H Ng Consultants (“SH Ng”), who sent two letters to Sanc hoon on 1 and 2 August 2003 and also supplied the latter with a doc ument c alled “Slope Analysis of Bund Wall”. CPG was, 


however, not satisfied with the method statement and did not approve the proposed method of c onstruc tion of the bund. It had c onc erns regarding the use of a “jointed spun pile” instead of a single-length spun pile of 25m in length. 

9       In midAugust, Sanc hoon dec ided to engage one Prof Harry Tan of the National University of Singapore to assist LCS Contrac tors in putting up the proper c alc ulations and justific ations to CPG to satisfy the latter with regard to the jointed spun pile issue. In early September 2003, after rec eiving a report from Prof Tan that dealt with the tec hnic al issues raised regarding the use of jointed spun piles, CPG ac c epted the bund proposal. It still, however, had doubts as to whether the bund would be able to safely support the loads that would be plac ed on it. In this c onnec tion, it was not only the piling rig that was going to be put onto the bund, but also Sanc hoon’s own heavy c onstruc tion equipment. Sanc hoon then instruc ted Prof Tan to analyse the safety aspec ts of the bund c onstruc tion and to propose a suitable method of c onstruc tion. On 12 September 2003, Prof Tan produc ed an analysis that indic ated that the use of a bund would be suitable provided that sand was used to c onstruc t it rather than earth. CPG ac c epted this report. LCS Contrac tors was not very happy about Prof Tan’s engagement regarding the c onstruc tion of the bund and did not want to be held liable for his fee. 

10     In the meantime, there was a c ertain amount of unhappiness between the parties regarding the progress of the c onstruc tion. The Revised Programme had moved forward the deadlines of some of the items of the subc ontrac t works. Going by the Revised Programme, Sanc hoon c laimed that LCS Contrac tors was in delay. LCS Contrac tors’ position was that it was not bound to adhere to the Revised Programme and in any event the delay was not substantial whether its progress was measured against the Original Programme or the Revised Programme. 

11     On 18 September 2003, LCS Contrac tors wrote to Sanc hoon stating that it had not agreed to Prof Tan’s report on the method of c onstruc tion of the bund and asking for Sanc hoon to give it partic ulars of the delay that Sanc hoon had ac c used LCS Contrac tors of c ausing. Ac c ording to Mr Chew of Sanc hoon, at that time, Sanc hoon was not prepared to release any payment for the work done by LCS Contrac tors up to that date without some sec urity that the latter would c arry out its work. Mr Chew had what he regarded as a “genuine c onc ern that if Sanc hoon paid LCS Contrac tors it would stop work”. 

12     Mr Lim told me that to meet this c onc ern, he had agreed to provide Sanc hoon with a performanc e bond (in c ase of defec ts) in exc hange for payment of LCS Contrac tors’ c laims. In the event, no performanc e bond was issued as Sanc hoon did not revert on the format of suc h bond. In the meantime, LCS Contrac tors had substantially c eased the exec ution of the subc ontrac t works with the c onsent or the ac quiesc enc e of Sanc hoon. When no performanc e bond format was forthc oming, Mr Lim dec ided to take further ac tion. 

13     On 7 Oc tober 2003, solic itors ac ting for LCS Contrac tors sent a letter of demand to Sanc hoon demanding payment of $444,878.72. Thereafter, Mr Chew had a meeting with Mr Lim. The purpose of the meeting was to try to resolve the issues between the two parties. Ac c ording to Mr Chew, at that meeting, Mr Lim stated that LCS Contrac tors wanted to be paid some $200, extra if it had to c onstruc t the bund from sand, as rec ommended by Prof Tan, instead of from earth. Mr Chew disagreed with this proposal bec ause he c onsidered that LCS Contrac tors should have known from the beginning that an earth bund was unsuitable. Mr Chew said that Mr Lim then refused to pay for the sand and it bec ame apparent to Sanc hoon that the only solution was for it to take over the remaining works as quic kly as possible to avoid the imposition of liquidated damages by the employer. I point out here that Mr Lim denied that he had ever asked for extra money to build the bund. His position was that LCS Contrac tors was ready and willing at all times to perform its c ontrac tual 


obligations. 

14     There were, thereafter, further settlement negotiations between the parties. On 15 Oc tober 2003, Sanc hoon produc ed a draft settlement agreement. This was rejec ted by LCS Contrac tors. Basic ally, the dispute was over the figures. Sanc hoon then took the view that an amic able settlement was not possible. On 6 November 2003, it terminated the subc ontrac t and gave LCS Contrac tors final notic e to remove all its mac hinery and equipment from the site. 

15     This ac tion was c ommenc ed in May 2004. LCS Contrac tors c laimed $444,878.72 being the alleged value of the work done by it under the subc ontrac t and alternatively c laimed the same sum on a _quantum meruit_ basis. In its final form, the Defenc e c ontained the following allegations of breac h of c ontrac t on the part of LCS Contrac tors: 

 (a) that LCS Contrac tors had failed to provide an adequate or safe method of temporary ac c ess for the jetty and pier works (earth bund-wall method); 

 (b) that LCS Contrac tors had failed to apply for the nec essary permits and/or grants of approval from relevant governmental bodies and authorities; and 

 (c ) that LCS Contrac tors had failed to c arry out the subc ontrac t works with due diligenc e, without unnec essary delay and with due expedition. 

Sanc hoon further pleaded that by reason of the aforesaid breac hes by LCS Contrac tors, the latter had wrongfully repudiated the agreement between the parties. Sometime between 7 Oc tober 2003 and 13 Oc tober 2003, Sanc hoon had offered to allow LCS Contrac tors to withdraw from the site in c onsideration of Sanc hoon making a payment of $204,566.40 with a retention of the sum of $145,345.60. By this c onduc t it had ac c epted the repudiation of LCS Contrac tors. In its Reply, LCS Contrac tors denied the breac hes asserted by Sanc hoon. 

**Issues** 

16     The issues posed by the parties are the following: 

 (a) Did LCS Contrac tors breac h the subc ontrac t? 

 (b) If so, were the breac hes repudiatory in nature, ie , so serious as to lead a reasonable person to c onc lude that LCS Contrac tors no longer intended to be bound by the provisions of the subc ontrac t, and in this c onnec tion, if there was more than one breac h, for the purpose of determining the repudiatory nature of suc h breac hes, should they be c onsidered individually or together? 

 (c ) If LCS Contrac tors was in breac h, was Sanc hoon required to give adequate notic e to LCS Contrac tors before purporting to terminate the subc ontrac t? 

 (d) If the foregoing issues are determined in favour of Sanc hoon, are the loss and damage c laimed by it too remote to be rec overable? 

**_Did LCS Contractors breach the subcontract in relation to the provision of temporary access for the jetty and pier works?_** 

17     Mr Joseph Liow, who ac ted for Sanc hoon submitted that LCS Contrac tors had warranted that it had the nec essary skill and expertise to c arry out the marine works. He also asserted that LCS 


Contrac tors had an obligation to produc e a method statement for the c onstruc tion of the bund. This obligation arose from c l 8 of the subc ontrac t whic h provided for the subc ontrac tor to c omply with all direc tions and instruc tions of the arc hitec t under the main c ontrac t in so far as suc h instruc tions related to the subc ontrac t works. 

18     Mr Liow pointed out that Mr Lim had agreed that during progress meetings at the site in February 2003, he had been informed that CPG required method statements for the various aspec ts of the subc ontrac t works. However, LCS Contrac tors had taken a long time to provide the method statement for the bund and the first report submitted by its c onsultant, SH Ng, was only forwarded on 16 July 2003. That report was inadequate. One major defic ienc y was that it did not c ontain a slope analysis. It also prompted a series of questions from CPG. As a result, a supplemental report was put up by SH Ng on 2 August 2003. Sanc hoon’s c ase was that notwithstanding the supplemental report, the method statement was still woefully inadequate. In this respec t, Mr Liow relied on the evidenc e given by CPG and Prof Tan. 

19     Ms Chew Saw Tin of CPG was not satisfied with the method statement for various reasons inc luding the lac k of c alc ulations relating to stability and also bec ause it appeared from the supplemental report that the material to be used for the bac kfill below the sea level would be dredged from the seabed. Ms Chew’s view was that seabed materials would not be sand but rather c layey material and marine c lay whic h c ould c ause pollution and whic h was unlikely to c ompac t when it was under water. Prof Tan’s evidenc e was that SH Ng’s c alc ulations did not address the issue of c ompac tion; its proposed method of c ompac ting the earth at intervals of 500mm was unworkable sinc e it would not be possible to c ompac t earth that was under water. Mr Liow pointed out that Dr Y S Lau, who gave expert evidenc e on behalf of LCS Contrac tors, had explained that an earth bund would be c onstruc ted in a marine environment by using a bulldozer to push sand into the sea during low tide. Dr Lau had c onc eded that the method desc ribed by SH Ng was not the same but sounded more like the method that would be employed when one built a bund on land. On stability, Prof Tan gave evidenc e as to why the slope analysis c arried out by SH Ng was flawed. Ac c ording to him, the c onsultant had not found the c ritic al slip c irc le to get to the lowest fac tor of safety for his design. Dr Lau agreed that this was a flaw in SH Ng’s analysis. Prof Tan went on to testify that even if sand had been used for the c onstruc tion, based on SH Ng’s design, the safety fac tor at the point where the bund reac hed the height of 9m would have been c lose to failure. He therefore c onsidered it unsafe. 

20     Mr Kelvin Chia, who ac ted for LCS Contrac tors, did not dispute that his c lient had given a warranty that it had the nec essary skill and expertise to c arry out the marine works. He c onsidered that the c ritic ism levelled against LCS Contrac tors was not that it was unable to c onstruc t a safe and usable bund. He pointed out that Mr Lim had testified that at the time of termination, LCS Contrac tors had already c onstruc ted about one third of one bund with no sign of imminent c ollapse and that this evidenc e had not been c hallenged. As Mr Chia saw it, what Sanc hoon was taking issue with was that LCS Contrac tors had been unable to proc ure a report from SH Ng that was ac c eptable to Sanc hoon and CPG. To Mr Chia, this was a non-issue as, during c ross-examination, Mr Lim had c onc eded that SH Ng’s submissions were inadequate. Mr Chia argued that the fac t that SH Ng’s reports were inadequate did not mean that LCS Contrac tors had breac hed the subc ontrac t. There was, he argued, no express provision in the subc ontrac t that stipulated that LCS Contrac tors was bound to justify the bund method of c onstruc tion by way of a report from a professional engineer. All that Sanc hoon was able to rely on in this regard was c l 8 of the subc ontrac t that required it to c omply with the direc tions and instruc tions of the arc hitec t. There had been no breac h of this provision bec ause first, LCS Contrac tors had been able to proc ure its c onsultant’s report on the bund only after the subc ontrac t was awarded on 10 June 2003 and it was c lear exac tly what loading had to be supported by the bund. Sec ond, the report had been submitted on 16 July 2003. A few days after that, CPG had replied 


with a series of c omments, queries and questions for SH Ng to address and these had been dealt with by SH Ng’s letter of 1 August 2003 and its slope analysis of 2 August 2003. Thereafter, neither Sanc hoon nor CPG had replied to LCS Contrac tors on the supplemental report. In fac t, Ms Chew’s evidenc e was that she had rec eived the supplemental report only on 15 August 2003 but had rejec ted the earth bund method before that date and before seeing SH Ng’s responses. Ms Chew also testified that she c ould not remember whether she had informed SH Ng that the employer was c onc erned that the bund might enc roac h from the site into neighbouring areas. Four days after the employer had expressed that c onc ern, Sanc hoon engaged Prof Tan to do a stage c oastal embankment study for the safe c onstruc tion of a c oastal platform for c onstruc tion purposes. 

21     Mr Chia further submitted that the above fac ts showed that LCS Contrac tors did not breac h c l 8 of the subc ontrac t. It had c omplied with the direc tions to produc e a method statement and thereafter, no further direc tions or instruc tions had been given to it and therefore no breac h c ould have oc c urred. LCS Contrac tors c ould not be ac c used of not following or not c omplying with “direc tions and instruc tions” when these had not been forthc oming. It was not as though CPG had told LCS Contrac tors to alter or modify SH Ng’s submissions and LCS Contrac tors had refused to do so. Instead, both parties had kept quiet and then Sanc hoon had removed the whole matter from the hands of LCS Contrac tors by appointing Prof Tan to take over from SH Ng. LCS Contrac tors had found out about the appointment only on 8 September 2003 whic h was nearly one week after the event. Mr Chia said that sinc e Sanc hoon had unilaterally transferred SH Ng’s job to Prof Tan, it did not lie in Sanc hoon’s mouth to ac c use LCS Contrac tors of “failing” to proc ure an ac c eptable method statement. 

22     Even after Prof Tan was appointed, it took him nearly one and a half months and two meetings (eac h lasting about two and a half hours and attended by no fewer than nine representatives from CPG) to produc e a report that was ac c eptable to CPG. Prof Tan was c ompelled to make two revisions to his report to reac h this result. LCS Contrac tors, therefore, submitted that the produc tion of an ac c eptable professional engineer’s report on the c onstruc tion of a bund-wall was not something that c ould be done in one sitting. Detailed feedbac k had to be given to the engineer involved and suffic ient time allotted to him to modify his report if nec essary. This was not done in the c ase of SH Ng. Whilst LCS Contrac tors was told by one Mr Chooi Yue Chiong, Sanc hoon’s projec t manager, in late August 2003, that CPG was unhappy with some aspec ts of SH Ng’s supplemental report, this sec ond-hand information hardly stood on the same footing as the detailed briefings given at the meetings that CPG had with Prof Tan. It was also c lear from the letter dated 25 August 2003 from LCS Contrac tors to SH Ng that LCS Contrac tors was not privy to muc h information as to what was wrong with SH Ng’s submissions. LCS Contrac tors still wanted SH Ng’s assistanc e on the matter as was c lear from its letter. In any c ase, even though SH Ng’s report was inadequate, Prof Tan himself had admitted that it was “salvageable” if SH Ng had done a lot more work. Dr Lau thought that there would be problems with SH Ng’s bund but that properly c onstruc ted it would have been stable. He also c onsidered Prof Tan’s final proposal to be a modific ation rather than a substantial c hange of SH Ng’s original design. 

23     On the basis of the foregoing summary of fac ts, Mr Chia submitted that it was premature for Sanc hoon to ac c use LCS Contrac tors of breac h of c ontrac t when the reality of the matter was that SH Ng had not been ac c orded the same opportunity to rec tify its report as Prof Tan had. It was entirely possible that had suc h opportunity been given to it, SH Ng would have improved on the c alc ulations. Alternatively, LCS Contrac tors or SH Ng c ould have engaged another professional engineer to tac kle the c alc ulations. 

24     I agree that there was no direc t obligation under the subc ontrac t for LCS Contrac tors to produc e a justific ation of the bund method of c onstruc tion by way of a report from a professional 


engineer. LCS Contrac tors was, however, required to c omply with the instruc tions of the c onsultants appointed by the employer pursuant to c l 8 of the subc ontrac t. Thus, when CPG required a method statement relating to the c onstruc tion of the bund, LCS Contrac tors had to provide one. LCS Contrac tors did so. CPG was not satisfied with the method statement and it therefore raised a number of queries on the same. These were passed by LCS Contrac tors to SH Ng whic h gave its responses. When those responses were sent to Sanc hoon, LCS Contrac tors had again c omplied with the instruc tions of CPG. Ms Chew’s evidenc e was that she rejec ted the bund method before she rec eived the c larific ation. As far as LCS Contrac tors was c onc erned, I do not think it was in breac h of c ontrac t at that stage as it had done everything nec essary to c omply with the instruc tions. It did not refuse to further c larify the matter or to obtain further information and c alc ulations from SH Ng. It was not even asked to do so and Mr Chia made a good point when he submitted that LCS Contrac tors c ould not be in breac h of instruc tions when no instruc tions had been issued. Even though LCS Contrac tors was aware in general terms, as appears from its letter of 25 August 2003 to SH Ng, why Ms Chew was not satisfied with SH Ng’s endorsement of the bund-wall, it was not able to rec tify these points without details of the objec tions being given to it. In any c ase, Dr Lau was of the opinion that CPG was being over-c autious in many of the queries that it raised bec ause the bund was a very small part of the whole projec t. As a temporary earth bund, it was not a c omplic ated struc ture and, in the hands of an experienc ed c ontrac tor, the building of the bund, even though it took plac e in the sea, would be a straightforward affair. I agree that in this situation, failure on the part of LCS Contrac tors to c ompletely deal with CPG’s c onc erns and espec ially when suc h c onc erns had not been c learly enunc iated to it after the sec ond submission, c annot be treated as a breac h of c l 8. 

25     Sanc hoon submitted that engaging Prof Tan to produc e the method statement was a reasonable c ourse of ac tion for it to take bec ause LCS Contrac tors did not appear to be able to produc e a satisfac tory method statement or design c omputation. It would have been more reasonable, in my view, for Sanc hoon to have taken this path had it c learly indic ated to LCS Contrac tors the defic ienc ies in SH Ng’s method statement and told the latter that if the same were not c orrec ted by a c ertain date it would appoint a new struc tural engineer to produc e the doc umentation. As matters stood, Sanc hoon went behind the bac k of LCS Contrac tors in relation to this appointment whic h it need not have done. As it turned out, subsequently, LCS Contrac tors agreed to c onstruc t the bund in ac c ordanc e with Prof Tan’s method though of c ourse there is some dispute as to whether it asked for extra payment in order to do so. It is also relevant that the portion of the bund in fac t c onstruc ted by LCS Contrac tors was stable and that LCS Contrac tors had previously c onstruc ted similar bunds without any problem. In my judgment, therefore, the fac t that the method statement produc ed by SH Ng was inadequate did not c onstitute a breac h of c ontrac t on the part of LCS Contrac tors. Even if it had been, I would not c onsider suc h breac h of c ontrac t by itself to be repudiatory in nature. 

**_Was LCS Contractors required to apply for permits from government bodies and authorities and, if so, was it in breach of this requirement?_** 

26     It was alleged by Sanc hoon at para 7.2(i) of its ReReAmended Defenc e and Counterc laim that LCS Contrac tors had refused to submit and make a formal applic ation to six named governmental authorities and had thereby ac ted in breac h of the subc ontrac t. This pleading was based on a letter dated 22 September 2003 from CPG to Sanc hoon. Sec tion A6 of this letter read as follows: 

6\. Statutory Submission and Approval 

 a) Submission and formal approval shall be made and obtained for [ sic ] the following authorities: 


 i. MPA (inc lude departments other than Cormet and Port Master); 

 ii. Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Environment; 

 iii. BCA; 

 iv. URA; 

 v. JTC; 

 vi. SLA [Singapore Land Authority]. 

 b) The c ontrac tor may require to make a formal presentation to all authorities mentioned with the presenc e of the CPG unless suc h authorities/departments do not require suc h c learanc es or approval. 

Sanc hoon submitted that this meant that it had to make applic ations for the approvals unless the authorities stated that the same were not required. 

27     Ac c ordingly, Sanc hoon and, in turn, LCS Contrac tors pursuant to c l 8 of the subc ontrac t, were c ontrac tually obliged to follow the instruc tions of CPG and make the nec essary applic ations. However, LCS Contrac tors did not c omply with this instruc tion and, as a result, Mr Chooi had to run around to deal with all the required departments. In his evidenc e, Mr Lim had admitted rec eiving from Sanc hoon a c opy of the letter of 22 September 2003. He stated that he had applied for the approval of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (“MPA”) but had not applied for the approval of the other authorities bec ause he c onsidered that the instruc tion had been given by CPG to Sanc hoon and that it was not LCS Contrac tors that had been asked to apply to the other five authorities. Sanc hoon submitted that it was not open to Mr Lim to take this position as it was quite c lear that sec tion A of CPG’s letter dealt with the temporary works for the jetty and piers and it was part 6 of this sec tion that spec ified the authorities from whom approval had to be sought. Sinc e those instruc tions were in relation to the proposed bund for the marine piling works, they c learly fell within the sc ope of works of LCS Contrac tors and the latter was obliged to c omply with the instruc tions and find out whether approvals from any or all of those authorities were required and, if so, obtain the same. Sanc hoon submitted that LCS Contrac tors had no lawful justific ation for not c omplying with the instruc tions of CPG c ontained in the letter of 22 September 2003. 

28     In its reply to this submission, LCS Contrac tors emphasised the paragraph in CPG’s letter that is quoted in [26] above. Mr Chia submitted that this c ontained a qualific ation, to wit, that the formal presentation would not be required if “suc h authorities/departments do not require suc h c learanc es or approvals”. He referred to Sanc hoon’s submission on the point whic h read, “Sanc hoon was to make submissions for approval unless suc h authorities _state_ that they do not require suc h c learanc es or approvals” [emphasis added] and argued that Sanc hoon had made a subtle alteration of CPG’s instruc tion by introduc ing the word “state”. Sanc hoon was therefore interpreting CPG’s direc tion to mean that a formal applic ation had to be made to all the authorities mentioned but that if any authority stated that it did not have to approve the bund c onstruc tion, Sanc hoon need not proc eed further with that applic ation. Sanc hoon’s interpretation, it was argued, was quite different from CPG’s original instruc tion whic h was simply to make a formal applic ation unless the authority or department did not require the same. 

29     Mr Chia further submitted that with the benefit of numerous years’ experienc e in building bunds, it was with great c onfidenc e that Mr Lim stated that there was no requirement for any 


approval exc ept that of MPA. That was why LCS Contrac tors did not make the submissions for approval to the other five authorities. In Mr Lim’s letter of 22 Marc h 2003 to Sanc hoon, he made it very c lear that LCS Contrac tors would only be applying for MPA’s approval. In fac t, this was obtained for the period of 11 April 2003 to 10 Oc tober 2003. The original programme for the subc ontrac t works also c ontained an item reading “Applic ation of Port Notic e from MPA and Approval”. No other submissions were mentioned bec ause there was no need for them. In any c ase, Mr Chooi himself had also stated in his Affidavit of Evidenc e-inChief that none of the stipulated governmental authorities ac tually issued any kind of permit for marine works or spec ified that a permit was required for suc h works. In Mr Chia’s submission, therefore, there was no breac h on the part of LCS Contrac tors when it failed to apply for approval from any of the authorities apart from MPA. 

30     From the above disc ussion, it is plain that the basic fac ts are not in dispute. An instruc tion was given by CPG to Sanc hoon and Sanc hoon in turn passed that instruc tion on to LCS Contrac tors. LCS Contrac tors took the view that it only needed to make an applic ation for approval to MPA and, sinc e this had already been done muc h earlier, did not approac h any authorities after rec eipt of the letter. As there was no spec ific requirement in the subc ontrac t for LCS Contrac tors to obtain any partic ular approval, the only way that LCS Contrac tors c ould be required to apply for approvals would be through an instruc tion issued by CPG that would be binding on it by virtue of c l 8 of the subc ontrac t. The issue therefore is whether CPG’s instruc tion meant that an applic ation had to be initiated and proc eeded with until the authority c onc erned stated it did not have to approve the works or whether an applic ation only had to be made if there was a prec eding requirement for suc h authority’s approval. This is a question of interpretation of CPG’s letter. In my judgment, the paragraph in question does require the c ontrac tor to make an applic ation for approval. I agree with Sanc hoon’s interpretation that suc h applic ation would have to be proc eeded with until an indic ation had been given by the authority c onc erned that its approval was not nec essary. Otherwise it would not have been nec essary for CPG to list the various authorities in sub-para (a). The purpose of setting out the list was to ensure that a submission for approval was made to those authorities and sub-para (b) made it c lear that unless it was asc ertained that the authorities did not need to issue their approvals, formal presentations would have to be made to them by the c ontrac tor in the presenc e of CPG itself. As it turned out, only MPA’s approval was needed whic h was what Mr Lim had maintained all along. However, CPG had no experienc e with marine bund c onstruc tion works and therefore erred on the side of prudenc e by listing six authorities whic h it thought might have some kind of jurisdic tion over the bund works. 

31     Whilst it may be understandable that LCS Contrac tors did not ac t on an instruc tion that it c onsidered to be unreasonable espec ially sinc e by the time it was issued, the relationship between Sanc hoon and LCS Contrac tors was no longer good and the parties were negotiating a settlement, LCS Contrac tors was not entitled to disregard the instruc tion entirely. CPG needed to be satisfied by formal doc umentation that the state of affairs on the issue of approvals was as represented by LCS Contrac tors. Thus, in my view, LCS Contrac tors was, tec hnic ally, in breac h of c ontrac t when it failed to take any steps to implement the instruc tions given by CPG. That breac h did not, however, c onstitute a repudiation of the subc ontrac t. It was a relatively minor matter and investigation by Mr Chooi showed subsequently that only MPA’s approval was really needed for the works. This had been obtained. The projec t c ould therefore have gone ahead even if other approvals had not been sought. 

**_Was LCS Contractors in breach of its obligations to carry out works with due diligence?_** 

32     Clause 4(b) of the subc ontrac t reads: 

 General Obligations 


 The subc ontrac tor shall upon and subjec t to these c onditions c arry out and c omplete the words diligently and with due expedition and without delay in suc h order as may be requested from time to time. 

Sanc hoon’s c ase as set out at para 7(1) of the ReReAmended Defenc e and Counterc laim was that notwithstanding that Sanc hoon had provided LCS Contrac tors with an alternative method of c onstruc tion as prepared by Prof Tan, LCS Contrac tors refused to c onstruc t the temporary ac c ess for the marine piling works. LCS Contrac tors was thereby in breac h of its duty to c arry out the works with due diligenc e and expedition and had delayed the progress of its own works and, c onsequently, the main c ontrac t programme. 

33     In his c losing submissions, Mr Liow relied first, on Mr Chew’s evidenc e in relation to his disc ussions with Mr Lim of LCS Contrac tors. Mr Chew asserted that after being informed of Prof Tan’s report on the bund, Mr Lim stated that he was willing to adopt Prof Tan’s method of c onstruc tion but that LCS Contrac tors wanted to be paid more than $200,000 extra to use sand (as direc ted by Prof Tan) instead of earth. This statement was made during the c ourse of the negotiations that took plac e after Sanc hoon rec eived LCS Contrac tors’ solic itors’ letter of demand of 7 Oc tober 2003. Sanc hoon did not, however, rec ord the demand made by LCS Contrac tors for extra money bec ause the parties were in the c ourse of negotiations. There was also other evidenc e whic h suggested that LCS Contrac tors did not wish to use sand to c onstruc t the bund and that it knew that if it did so, its c ost would inc rease. This was as follows: 

 (a) SH Ng had stated in its letter of 1 August 2003 that the material used in c onstruc ting that portion of the bund that would be below sea level would be dredged from the seabed at the side itself. SH Ng therefore assumed that there would be enough sand. 

 (b) Ms Chew had testified that upon rec eiving SH Ng’s sec ond report, she had c onsulted a friend who was familiar with marine works and they had arrived at the c onc lusion that there would not be enough sand at the seaside to do what SH Ng had proposed. When Ms Chew asked Mr Lim whether the site would provide suffic ient sand, he had replied that it would not and then told Ms Chew that he would be using soil from other sites to c onstruc t the bund. 

 (c ) Ms Chew explained that she had rejec ted the bund method on 14 August 2003 bec ause LCS Contrac tors had suggested the use of soil from other sites and this would mean making the sea a dumping ground, a position that was unac c eptable to her. 

 (d) The original intention of LCS Contrac tors was to use soil from other sites whic h Mr Lim said he c ould obtain for free. But when Mr Lim saw Prof Tan’s report he thought, erroneously, that he would have to use “washed sand” whic h was muc h more expensive than ordinary untreated sand. 

34     In view of the foregoing c irc umstanc es, it was submitted that, on the balanc e of probabilities, when one c onsiders how muc h sand would be required to build the proposed earth bunds (at least 20,625m³ for two bunds) and that this would c ost at least $123,750 (at $6 per c ubic metre) if unwashed sand was used and more if washed sand (at $20 to $30 per c ubic metre) was used, Mr Lim did in fac t tell Mr Chew that LCS Contrac tors would not c arry out Prof Tan’s rec ommendation unless it was paid some $200,000 extra. Sanc hoon then refused to pay the extra amount demanded by Mr Lim and LCS Contrac tors refused to c arry out the c ontrac ted works. As suc h, LCS Contrac tors was in breac h of c ontrac t and by suc h breac h had repudiated the subc ontrac t. 

35     In response, Mr Chia submitted that even though LCS Contrac tors was aggrieved at the time 


that SH Ng was not given a further opportunity to rec tify its report, it had readily agreed to abide by Prof Tan’s rec ommendations. Mr Lim had said as muc h in his evidenc e. During c ross-examination also, Mr Lim reiterated that he had agreed to the report; it was only the fee that he had not agreed to pay. As regards the c laim that Mr Lim had demanded an extra $200,000 in order to c arry out Prof Tan’s method of c onstruc tion and that this demand was a repudiation of the subc ontrac t, LCS Contrac tors denied this. First, Sanc hoon’s position was that it had ac c epted LCS Contrac tors’ repudiation of the subc ontrac t on 7 Oc tober 2003, whic h nec essarily meant that the alleged breac hes had oc c urred on or before 7 Oc tober 2003. However, Prof Tan’s report was only approved by CPG on 13 Oc tober 2003. It would therefore be wrong for Sanc hoon to say that LCS Contrac tors had repudiated the subc ontrac t by not proc eeding with the works as of 7 Oc tober 2003. Sec ond, Mr Lim had never tried to extort any extra money from Sanc hoon and this story had been made up by Mr Chew to justify the termination of the subc ontrac t. 

36     In substantiation of his submission on the extortion point, Mr Chia made several arguments. First, it was c laimed by Mr Chew that LCS Contrac tors’ alleged “extortion” took plac e at a settlement meeting of 13 Oc tober 2003. If Sanc hoon were c orrec t, LCS Contrac tors would be guilty of an express renunc iation of the subc ontrac t whic h would entitle Sanc hoon to terminate it. However, Sanc hoon, by its pleading, was relying on alleged breac hes that arose on or before 7 Oc tober 2003 and c ould not therefore rely on an express breac h whic h allegedly oc c urred one week after the c utoff date. Sec ond, it had pleaded that LCS Contrac tors had “refused to c arry out [its] works to c onstruc t a temporary ac c ess for the marine piling works” but had not pleaded that LCS Contrac tors was prepared to do so on terms as to additional payment. Third, there was a problem of evidenc e in that there was no rec ord in any letter, minutes of meeting or other doc ument that LCS Contrac tors had expressly renounc ed the subc ontrac t at the meeting of 13 Oc tober 2003. In c ross-examination, Mr Chew agreed that if LCS Contrac tors had really refused to proc eed with the works unless it obtained additional payment whic h was not due under the subc ontrac t, he would have c onsidered this to be a very serious matter. He agreed this was bec ause suc h c onduc t would have shown onc e and for all that LCS Contrac tors did not intend to proc eed with the work. 

37     Whilst it was argued by Sanc hoon that it had not put the refusal to pay for the sand in writing as parties were at that time negotiating to reac h a settlement, even if that were true, c ontended Mr Chia, there was nothing to stop Sanc hoon from referring to this “express renunc iation” in its termination notic e of 6 November 2003. In fac t, it would be the most natural thing in the world to rec ite a litany of LCS Contrac tors’ breac hes in the termination letter. The position c onsistently taken by LCS Contrac tors was that it wanted to proc eed with the subc ontrac t works and that is why it insisted on amending the draft settlement agreement to reflec t the fac t that it was not the desire of LCS Contrac tors to withdraw from the works. One of Sanc hoon’s witnesses gave evidenc e of Mr Lim’s state of mind as follows: 

 During my disc ussion with Mr Lim Chin San in the c anteen itself, I feel that in his opinions, he feel that he has been c heated in this whole c ontrac t itself bec ause his method is one of the c heapest way to c arry out to do the c onstruc tions. And when we realised that it is suc h a good way to c arry out the c onstruc tions, we dec ided to abandon him and bring in another c ontrac tor to c arry out his method and take advantage of the extra margins. 

This evidenc e of one Mr Toh Lim Kwee who worked for Sanc hoon showed that Mr Lim felt aggrieved at being ousted from the subc ontrac t and that he had wanted to proc eed with it. This evidenc e was c onsistent with the fac t that LCS Contrac tors had written to Sanc hoon in Oc tober and November 2003 stating that Sanc hoon wanted to take over LCS Contrac tors’ works. In Mr Chia’s view, it was signific ant that this assertion was not subsequently denied in writing by Sanc hoon. 


38     Having c onsidered all the evidenc e inc luding Mr Lim’s denial in c ourt that he had tried to extrac t extra money for building the bund ac c ording to Prof Tan’s method statement, I have c ome to the c onc lusion that LCS Contrac tors must be believed on this point. There was no c redible evidenc e to support Sanc hoon’s assertion that suc h an extortion was attempted. Sanc hoon’s behaviour at the time was not c onsistent with suc h a demand having been made. Sanc hoon never doc umented it or used it as a basis to justify its ac tions. It was only after the c ommenc ement of the ac tion that Mr Chew made affidavits asserting the existenc e of the demand. Further, by the time that the demand was allegedly made, the evidenc e showed that Sanc hoon had already the intention of appointing another subc ontrac tor, M/s Zap Piling, to take over the subc ontrac t works from LCS Contrac tors. On 7 Oc tober 2003, Sanc hoon informed CPG that it intended to c hange the marine subc ontrac tor from LCS Contrac tors to Zap Piling. Three days later, CPG informed Sanc hoon that it had no objec tion in princ iple to the appointment of Zap Piling to c onstruc t the bund-wall. In these c irc umstanc es, had LCS Contrac tors made the demand it would have been leapt upon by Sanc hoon as the perfec t exc use to terminate LCS Contrac tors without risk and substitute Zap Piling in its plac e. Yet, no suc h ac c usation was made at that time, _ie_ , on 13 Oc tober 2003 or even in the termination letter sent in November 2003. I therefore find that there was no express refusal by LCS Contrac tors to c onstruc t the bund-wall as asserted by Sanc hoon. 

39     Sanc hoon’s c ase that LCS Contrac tors had not proc eeded with the works with due diligenc e did not, however, rest only on the extortion point. It also c ontended that, based on the Revised Programme, LCS Contrac tors had not c arried out its works with due diligenc e nor had it proc eeded with due expedition. On 6 November 2003 when the subc ontrac t was terminated, the c onstruc tion of the bund for the jetty had not started. On the basis of the Revised Programme, this c onstruc tion was more than three months overdue as it should have been c ompleted by 2 August 2003. 

40     The issue here is whether LCS Contrac tors was bound to follow the Revised Programme rather than the Original Programme. The position taken by LCS Contrac tors was that the Revised Programme was an ac c elerated programme. Sanc hoon disputed this. It relied on the evidenc e given under c rossexamination by Daniel Thomas Connors, a c onstruc tion management spec ialist, who was c alled as an expert witness for LCS Contrac tors. He agreed that a programme sc hedule was a planning guide for a c ontrac tor’s work and manpower requirements. He ac c epted that if one looked at suc h a programme and ac tivities were bunc hed at one end of the programme there was a possibility that a delay c ould oc c ur bec ause by the time one reac hed that point, one might not have enough manpower to c arry out all those ac tivities. Therefore, where one antic ipated delay bec ause of the bunc hing up of ac tivities, one should rework the programme to spread out the work more evenly. When taken through the Revised Programme, Mr Connors agreed that it gave LCS Contrac tors less time to c arry out its works in respec t of the jetty but gave the latter more time to do the works in respec t of the long and short piers. He was then asked whether he agreed that under the Revised Programme, only the jetty works were ac c elerated. He disagreed bec ause the long and short piers were originally sc heduled to be c ompleted on 24 April 2004 but under the Revised Programme, the c ompletion date was brought forward to 4 February 2004, so although LCS Contrac tors had been given more time to do the works, those works had to be c ompleted earlier in the Programme. Mr Liow submitted that this answer was not c onsistent with Mr Connors’ earlier answer in whic h he had defined ac c eleration as being the situation where a c ontrac tor was given less time in whic h to c arry out a partic ular ac tivity. 

41     Mr Liow submitted that the revision of a programme oc c urred in almost every c onstruc tion projec t bec ause of the problems that would c rop up on site. The projec t manager would then have to revise the programme to make sure that the c ontrac tors c ould meet their deadlines. He pointed out that Mr Connors had agreed that the sequenc e of ac tivities that was originally planned might not be possible in prac tic e bec ause of c hanges on site. He then submitted that the Revised Programme was c onsistent with a revision of a programme to take into ac c ount the c irc umstanc es at the site. It was 


a programme that was reasonable in that instead of allowing ac tivities to bunc h up towards the end of the programme sc hedule, some ac tivities were moved forward. In any c ase, under c l 4(b) of the subc ontrac t, LCS Contrac tors were obliged to do the works “in suc h order as may be requested from time to time”. Sanc hoon therefore had the right to direc t the order in whic h the works had to be c arried out and LCS Contrac tors was obliged to follow suc h direc tion. 

42     The position taken by LCS Contrac tors was that the Original Programme issued on 24 Marc h 2003 should govern the progress of the subc ontrac t works bec ause: 

 (a) it was the only programme in existenc e at the time the subc ontrac t was formally awarded to LCS Contrac tors on 10 June 2003; and 

 (b) the Revised Programme whic h was issued on 28 June 2003 was unreasonable. 

Whilst the Original Programme was in effec t from 24 Marc h 2003 up to 28 June 2003 and LCS Contrac tors may well have been planning its works in ac c ordanc e with that programme, as I see it, there was nothing in the subc ontrac t that prevented Sanc hoon from c hanging the Original Programme if it had a good reason to do so and did not then impose unreasonable time limits on LCS Contrac tors. In fac t, c l 4(b) of the subc ontrac t indic ated that the order of the works might be c hanged from time to time. That of c ourse would not give Sanc hoon _carte blanche_ and to c hop and c hange the programme as it saw fit regardless of the situation on the ground and the inc onvenienc e to the subc ontrac tor. It would, however, allow Sanc hoon to make reasonable c hanges to the programme. I therefore take the view that if the Revised Programme was reasonable, LCS Contrac tors would have to follow it. 

43     Whilst Sanc hoon had pleaded that the Original Programme had to be c hanged bec ause it was no longer realistic given the fac t that LCS Contrac tors’ work was delayed, Mr Chooi testified that the Revised Programme arose not bec ause of suc h delay, but bec ause he thought that the Original Programme worked out by Mr Marvin Chia, who had been the projec t manager before Mr Chooi joined Sanc hoon, was not realistic. He said the c onsultants had observed that the sc heduling in the Original Programme whic h provided for the marine works to start sometime towards the end of 2003, might not give the c ontrac tors suffic ient time to c omplete the c onstruc tion. Mr Chooi agreed with this observation and he reviewed the programme and issued the Revised Programme whic h then spec ified, _inter alia_ , earlier start dates for the subc ontrac t works. 

44     Mr Chia submitted that there was no evidenc e that CPG had in fac t said that the Original Programme was unrealistic. Mr Chooi had not been able to point, during c ross-examination, to any minutes of meeting where this observation had been rec orded. He c ould not remember if it had been made at a meeting or at an informal disc ussion. 

45     LCS Contrac tors c onsidered that the Revised Programme was unreasonable bec ause it shortened the time lines available to it within whic h to do the work. It had also brought forward the c ommenc ement date of the work. For example, the works on the long pier were supposed to start in January 2004 and c ontinue until Marc h 2004. Under the Revised Programme, the c ommenc ement date was brought forward to Oc tober 2003. Then, for the short pier the work was supposed to c ommenc e in midMarc h 2004 and that date was brought forward to midDec ember 2003. Under c rossexamination, Mr Chew had agreed that the programme had been ac c elerated. It was also notable that the Revised Programme was sent to LCS Contrac tors on a Saturday morning and it was asked to revert on the same by the following Monday morning. LCS Contrac tors did not have suffic ient time to c omment and thus the Revised Programme did not reflec t any input from it. 


46     LCS Contrac tors submitted that the Revised Programme was unfair and unreasonable bec ause the deadlines for c ertain aspec ts of the subc ontrac t works were unreasonably ac c elerated. Mr Connors gave evidenc e that the Revised Programme set out entirely new requirements c ompared with the Original Programme. These new requirements inc luded: 

 (a) ac tivity c ommenc ement dates that were from three to four months earlier than the dates originally approved by CPG; 

 (b) c onc urrenc y between ac tivities that were not envisaged by the Original Programme and whic h would have required the mobilisation of a sec ond piling rig; 

 (c ) a reduc tion in the planned duration for various ac tivities; and 

 (d) a requirement that the jetty and pier works be c ompleted three to four months earlier than under the Original Programme. 

In Mr Connors’ view, the Revised Programme would be more ac c urately termed an “ac c elerated programme”. 

47     There was evidenc e that there was some delay under the Original Programme. This was in relation to the wharf spun-pile works. The c ommenc ement of these works was delayed bec ause of a c hange in the dimensions of the wharf sheet piles. Mr Chew agreed that the delay in installing these sheet piles arose from the c hanges to the spec ific ations for these materials. Mr Connors c onsidered that that delay was the responsibility of Sanc hoon. Ac c ording to the Original Programme, that work was intended to c ommenc e in May 2003 but it was only on 30 June 2003 that Sanc hoon made c hanges to that work whic h had an impac t on the layout of the piles. Mr Connors said that until that layout was established with finality, the installation c ould not proc eed. Mr Connors c onc luded that the Revised Programme was a “c atc h-up” programme for the spun-pile works but for all other ac tivities it was an ac c eleration. Further, the evidenc e was that as between the parties, Sanc hoon was responsible for proc uring the sheet piles. It plac ed the orders direc tly with the suppliers, Hoe Seng Huat Hardware Co (Pte) Ltd, and c o-ordinated the delivery sc hedule. There was some suggestion that Sanc hoon plac ed its order for the sheet piles late for reasons of ec onomy and, whilst this may have been a fac tor, the primary reason for the late delivery of the sheet piles was that Sanc hoon only c hanged the spec ific ations and dimensions of the piles on 30 June 2003. Thus, the sheet piles were delivered late primarily bec ause of the c hange in their dimensions. 

48     It was c lear from Mr Connors’ report that he regarded the Revised Programme as an ac c elerated programme. He did not ac c ept that there were good reasons for the c hange. Whilst he did give evidenc e on the nec essity for c hanges in programmes from time to time as quoted in [40] above, when all his evidenc e is looked at in c ontext, it c an be seen that those answers addressed the theoretic al possibilities raised by Mr Liow during c ross-examination. He did not at any time agree that those answers applied to the Revised Programme. 

49     Sanc hoon’s position regarding the Revised Programme was also undermined by frequent c hanges. As Mr Chia pointed out, in the pleadings, the Revised Programme was stated as having c ome about bec ause the work of LCS Contrac tors had been delayed. In c ourt, however, Mr Chooi’s evidenc e was that the Revised Programme was nec essary bec ause the Original Programme was unrealistic but that at the time the revision took plac e, LCS Contrac tors was not in delay. Then, when it c ame to the submissions, Sanc hoon c hanged its position again and submitted that the Revised Programme had to be issued to prevent “bunc hing up” of ac tivities. Contrary to the pleadings therefore, Sanc hoon’s final position was that the revision was not ac tuated by LCS Contrac tors’ delay 


but by the antic ipation of delay. This was why in the final submissions, Sanc hoon used phrases like “a possibility of delay”, “where one antic ipates delay” and “a potential delay”. 

50     In my judgment, Sanc hoon has not shown that the c hange in the programme sc hedule was nec essitated by any on-site c irc umstanc e c reated or c ontributed to by LCS Contrac tors. It is diffic ult to determine the reason for the revision in view of Sanc hoon’s c ontinual c hanges of position. Perhaps the true answer is to be found in Mr Chooi’s evidenc e that when he took over the projec t and reviewed the sc hedule, he was c onc erned that it was unrealistic and revised it ac c ordingly. If that was the c ase and sinc e the effec t of the revisions was to drastic ally c hange the timing of LCS Contrac tors’ works, Sanc hoon should have worked with LCS Contrac tors in drawing up the Revised Programme instead of more or less presenting it with a _fait accompli_. Having given LCS Contrac tors an ac c elerated programme, it was not reasonable for Sanc hoon to c omplain a mere three months later that LCS Contrac tors was in delay. Whilst c l 4(b) of the subc ontrac t stated that the subc ontrac tor was obliged to c arry out and c omplete the works in suc h order as the main c ontrac tor might request from time to time, that did not mean that Sanc hoon c ould c ompress the time otherwise alloc ated to LCS Contrac tors to c arry out the works in. As Mr Chia submitted, that c lause did not relieve Sanc hoon of the burden of showing that the Revised Programme was reasonable. In this respec t, it is relevant that para 30.145 of _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ , vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2003 Reissue) states that the c ontrac tor has a right to the amount of time alloc ated to him by the c ontrac t within whic h to c omplete his work and that any purported shortening of the c ompletion date would be an infringement of this right. 

51     Even if the Revised Programme was reasonable and therefore applic able to the subc ontrac t works, I ac c ept the submission of Mr Chia that Sanc hoon had failed to show, on a balanc e of probabilities, that LCS Contrac tors had not c arried out the subc ontrac t works “with due diligenc e and expedition [thereby] delay[ing] the progress of their works, and c onsequently the main c ontrac t programme” as asserted in para 7.3(l) of the ReReAmended Defenc e and Counterc laim. Mr Connors had examined the ac tual progress of the subc ontrac t works in detail in his expert report. He then proc eeded to c onsider the impac t of any “delay” in the said works on the Revised Programme. His c onc lusion was that the jetty and pier works would still have been c ompleted well before the main c ontrac t c ompletion date and that there would have been no delay c aused to Sanc hoon’s main c ontrac t works. This analysis was not c hallenged by Sanc hoon during c ross-examination. 

52     The onus was on Sanc hoon to raise and prove the various delaying events, if any, c aused by or attributable to LCS Contrac tors and to show that suc h events led to an overall delay in the works under the subc ontrac t and the main c ontrac t. On this issue, Sanc hoon relied substantially on the evidenc e of Mr Chooi but when his evidenc e is c onsidered as a whole, it does not establish this point. Sanc hoon did not even make a serious attempt to quantify the extent of delay sustained by it. Not every delay c an give rise to an inferenc e of lac k of due diligenc e and therefore it is important to quantify the delay and show its impac t on the projec t as a whole. Even though there may have been some delay on the part of LCS Contrac tors and Sanc hoon may have been frustrated at the apparent lac k of progress, it was not able in the evidenc e to show how suc h delay would have affec ted the progress of the works as a whole. On a c onsideration of all of the evidenc e in the c ase, I find that Sanc hoon has not disc harged the burden of proving that LCS Contrac tors failed to c arry out its work with due diligenc e. 

**Conclusion** 

53     I have found that there was only one, relatively minor, breac h of c ontrac t on the part of LCS Contrac tors, _ie_ , its failure to follow the instruc tions to obtain approvals from spec ified government authorities. That breac h entitled Sanc hoon to make a c laim for the damages, if any, it had sustained 


by reason of the breac h. It did not entitle Sanc hoon to terminate the subc ontrac t. The other breac hes of c ontrac t pleaded by Sanc hoon were not established. In the result, LCS Contrac tors is entitled to judgment for the sum of $219,912 and to interloc utory judgment for assessment of the value of the work done by it and the damages suffered by it by reason of the wrongful termination of the subc ontrac t. However, Sanc hoon is entitled to judgment for damages to be assessed in relation to the breac h of c ontrac t by LCS Contrac tors as held above. Those damages c an be set off against the damages payable to LCS Contrac tors. I also award 95% of the c osts of the c laim and the Defenc e to the Counterc laim to LCS Contrac tors.
