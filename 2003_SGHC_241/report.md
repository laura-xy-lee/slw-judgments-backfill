_Contract_ – _Breach_ – _Whether plaintiffs in breach of Settlement Agreement._ 

By a Joint Venture Agreement dated 18 June 1997 (“the JV Agreement”) the plaintiffs and the defendants agreed to develop a joint venture projec t to generate elec tric ity by two barge-mounted power plants in the State of Andhra Pradesh, India. The State government’s plan is to provide more elec tric ity to its people by allowing independent power providers (“IPPs”) to build, own and operate power plants. The joint venture projec t c ompany, known as EPS Oakwell Power Limited (“EOPL”) was owned as to 87.5% by the defendants and as to the remaining 12.5% by the plaintiffs. Diffic ulties or to put it neutrally new developments emerged in the c ourse of the implementation of the joint venture and parties entered into a revised Co-operation Agreement (“Co-operation Agreement”) and a revised Shareholders Agreement both dated 17 Oc tober 1997. During the ensuing period of about 12 months, disputes arose between the parties, to whic h I shall refer later in this judgment. Those disputes were dealt with and fully resolved by a Settlement Agreement (“the Settlement Agreement”) between the plaintiffs and defendants and dated 29 Dec ember 1998. 

2       Under the Settlement Agreement, the defendants would own EOPL in respec t of 100% of it shareholdings (to the extent permitted under Indian law). The defendants for its part agreed to pay the plaintiffs US$3,015,000.00. Payment was in the form of the issue to the plaintiffs of 1,850, defendants’ shares, whic h were listed in Canada. The defendants further agreed to pay the plaintiffs the sum of US$2,790,000.00 whic h would have been payable within 30 days after the drawdown of funds on financ ial c losure of the projec t. The financ ial c losure refers to the proc urement of financ ing by EOPL to c omplete and operate the power plants, as I will elaborate shortly. On the basis that the joint venture would c ontinue after the power plants bec ome c ommerc ially operational, the defendants also agreed to the payment of an annual sum equivalent to 6.25% p.a. of the ac tual c ash flow for foreign repatriation in the first five years of c ommerc ial operation (as defined in the Settlement Agreement (“the 6.25% Annual Sum”). 

3       The defendants failed to ac hieve financ ial c losure after the expiry of a reasonable time. The defendants rec ognized its inability to c omplete the Projec t and sold out part of its interest to The VBC Group whic h c omprised, amongst other c ompanies, Koneseema Power Corporation Limited (“KPCL”) and VBC Ferro Alloys Limited, all of whic h are inc orporated in India. The sale to the VBC Group was under a Memorandum of Agreement dated 16 July 1999. Oakwell was also sanguine enough to realize that the defendants were not making any progress in the implementation of the Projec t. It therefore welc omed VBC Group’s entry on c ondition that its rights and entitlements under the Settlement Agreement were c learly preserved on an express indemnity from the defendants. That 


indemnity related to the bonds, whic h the plaintiffs had given to both APSEB (later known as “APTRANSCO” and the Government of Andhra Pradesh (“GOAP”)) to c omplete and operate the Projec t**.** There was an arrangement under whic h the defendants had agreed to pay the plaintiffs the sum of US$500,000.00 out of what the VBC Group had agreed to pay the defendants. The defendants did not pay the plaintiffs and nothing turn in these proc eedings in relation to that understanding. 

4       By an agreement dated 10 August 2000 entered into between the defendants and the VBC Group, whic h revised their earlier MOA dated 16 July 1999, the defendants agreed to transfer its entire interest in EOPL to the VBC Group for the pric e of US$4,463,000.00. In spite of the plaintiffs’ interest in the Projec t, and its proprietary status as the Original Promoter, the defendants deny any liability to pay the plaintiffs on two princ ipal grounds. First, it c laims that the plaintiffs were in breac h of the Settlement Agreement in that it had undermined the interest of the joint venture by writing to APTRANSCO and others. The plaintiffs had also allegedly interfered with the defendants’ relationship with the VBC Group whic h resulted in disputes between the VBC Group and the defendants. Sec ondly, the defendants c laims that the Settlement Agreement was frustrated by a c hange of c irc umstanc es whic h materially affec ted the Projec t as a result of whic h the defendants, it c laims, was disc harged from any liability under the Settlement Agreement. 

5       The plaintiffs rejec t these allegations. It c laims that it is entitled under c lause 1.3.1 of the Settlement Agreement to rec eive under the Settlement Agreement the sum of US$2,790,000 within 30 days from the fist draw-down of funds by the defendants and/or EOPL after the Financ ial Closure of the Projec t. Under this c laim for a liquidated sum, the plaintiffs say it is prepared to give a disc ount of US$790,000 if proof were furnished that a payment of INR 30 million had been made on the plaintiffs’ behalf. The plaintiffs deny that any proof of suc h payment has been established in these proc eedings. In the further alternative, the plaintiffs are also prepared to give c redit for the sum of US$350,000. in c irc umstanc es I will allude to later. 

6       It further c laims that under c lause 1.4.1 of the Settlement Agreement the defendants agreed to pay to the plaintiffs the equivalent of 6.25% of the ac tual Cash Flow For Foreign Repatriation for eac h of the first 5 years after the Commerc ial Operation Date of the Projec t. The Settlement Agreement set out the formula by whic h the Cash Flow For Foreign Repatriation is to be c alc ulated. As the defendants had divested all its interest in EOPL to the VBC Group, it would not be operating the power plants and there would be no Cash Flow for any c alc ulation under the Settlement Agreement. Alternatively, the plaintiffs c laim damages under this head of damages to be assessed on a number of bases, to whic h I will return later in this judgment. 

7       In these premises, the plaintiffs rely on the princ iple of law that where a person is under an express obligation to pay money on a c ertain event, he c annot by his own ac t be the means by whic h his obligation c an be avoided or reduc ed. Ac c ordingly, the defendants, who had made it impossible for the oc c urrenc e of the event or events, c annot rely on the non-happening of the event as an exc use for non-payment. The plaintiffs rely on _Bournemouth & Boscome Athletic Football Club & Co Ltd v Manchester United Football Club Ltd_ [1980] Unreported, to whic h I shall return later. 

**The facts** 

8       I will now set out the fac ts as I find them after evaluating the massive doc umentary evidenc e and the oral evidenc e of 21 witnesses whose evidenc e I heard over 13 days. 

9       The plaintiffs, as explained by Mr Low Beng Tin (“Mr Low”), its Managing Direc tor at all material times, have been in the business of supplying engineering produc ts and engineering servic es 


in the oil, gas and marine industries. In 1994 it was listed on the sec ondary board of the SGX. In 1995 it was looking into power development ac tivities, whic h led it to explore power development projec ts in India whic h was seen to be in some need for elec tric al power. It engaged a c onsultanc y firm known as Aarken Consultants Pvt Limited (“Aarken”) to identify potential projec ts and assist in the preparation of bids for suc h projec ts. 

10     Mr Amarc hand Shrishrimal (“Mr Amarc hand”) of Aarken gave evidenc e for the plaintiffs. He dealt with all matters whic h had to be handled in India. Mr Eric Leow (“Mr Leow”), who was the first to give evidenc e for the plaintiffs, handled the Singapore end of things. Mr Leow had substantial experienc e in respec t of barge mounted power projec ts, having being involved from 1993 to 1996 in several power projec ts in different c ountries suc h as the Philippines, Nic aragua, Peoples’ Republic of China and India, whic h were barge mounted power projec ts. 

11     In early 1995, the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh invited bids through an international c ompetitive bid. The plaintiffs were awarded by the Andhra Pradesh State Elec tric ity Board (“APSEB”) to set up two 100MW internal c ombustion diesel engine tec hnology barge mounted power plants at Andhra Pradesh (“the Projec t”). The Projec t was modified from time to time. The tariffs inc luded a levellised c apac ity c harge c omprising a foreign debt c harge of US$0.0233 per unit of energy for 7 years and other fixed c harges of INR0.80 per unit of energy, making a total of about INR1.5 (at the then prevailing rate of exc hange). 

12     Following the award of the Projec t, the plaintiffs and APSEB entered into two power purc hase agreements dated 31 Marc h 1997 (“the PPAs”) in respec t of the Projec t. It was provided under the PPAs that the plaintiffs would inc orporate a c ompany in India. That was understood to be the spec ial purpose c ompany whic h would undertake the Projec t. Suc h a c ompany was later inc orporated and named EPS Oakwell Power Limited (“EOPL” ) or what is sometimes referred to as the Projec t Company. 

13     APSEB and all c onc erned intended the Projec t to be of short gestation. It was intended that it should be set up and running quic kly and initially, the time frame was 13 months. Later, it was extended to a 15 month period, i.e. by the end of June 1998. 

14     I shall refer, for illustration, to the PPA dated 31 Marc h 1997 entered into between APSEB and the plaintiffs for power purc hase in relation to the Barge Mounted Power Projec t at Kakinda, Andhra Pradesh, India. The plaintiffs agreed to a number of undertakings under Artic le 7 of the PPA. By that Artic le, it c ovenanted and agreed with the APSEB to: 

 “(a) use all reasonable efforts to c onstruc t the Projec t 

 in ac c ordanc e with the c onstruc tion c ontrac t and to 

 operate the Projec t in ac c ordanc e with Prudent Utility 

 Prac tic es; 

 (b) ..... 

 (e) use all reasonable efforts to cause the date of Financial Closing to occur within Six (6) months of the date of signing of this Agreement and furnish to the Board periodic progress reports (not less than monthly) regarding the same and in any case cause 


 Financial Closing to occur not later than twelve (12) months from the date of signing of this Agreement”. (emphasis added) 

15     As the original promoter of the Projec t, the plaintiffs were required to provide an indemnity bond in respec t of the Projec t to the Government of Andhra Pradesh (“GOAP”). It bound itself to indemnify the APSEB if the Projec t Company shall fail to c omplete the Projec t in ac c ordanc e with the several agreements. 

16     The estimated c ost of the Projec t was about US$217 million. It was within the c ontemplation of the plaintiffs that the Projec t would require an equity share of between 20%-30% of the total estimated c osts and it was projec ted that the remaining c osts c ould be financ ed by loans from financ ial institutions. Due to the sc ale of the projec ted c osts, the plaintiffs had to find one or more third parties to partic ipate with it in the equity portion. 

**Defendants’ entry into the Project** 

17     The plaintiffs were in the c ourse of disc ussions with various potential equity partic ipants, whic h Mr Leow was tasked to proc ure, when Aarken informed it about the defendants’ interest in partic ipating in the Projec t. Serious negotiations followed. The defendants’ representatives were Mr James Cassina (“Mr Cassina”), initially a direc tor of the defendant and who later bec ame its Chairman, Mr John Howard Brake (“Mr Brake”), Mr Roland Mauger and Mr Ramuji Nandiga (“Mr Ramuji”). They met Mr Low and Mr Leow at the plaintiffs’ offic e in Singapore over a few days in June 1997. Mr Amarc hand was also present. The two parties disc ussed the broad princ ipal terms of c o-operation. They were later joined by Mrs Rita Mukerji (Mrs Mukerji”) and Mr Ramesh Kumar Naroola (“Mr Naroola”). Both of them are direc tors of Aarken. Mr Naroola was at the material times also a c onsultant and legal adviser of Aarken. Subsequently, Mrs Mukerji was a c onsultant to the Projec t from July 1996 and was also a direc tor of EOPL and an alternate direc tor to Mr Cassina on the board of EOPL. Mrs Mukerji was sc heduled to have given evidenc e on behalf of the defendants on the developments of the Power Projec t from July 1996 to August 2000 and on the legitimate use of the Projec t funds. She did not give viva voc e evidenc e and her affidavit evidenc e was expunged from the rec ords. 

18     In the c ourse of their presentation, the representatives of the defendants impressed the plaintiffs’ top management. They spoke about the defendants’ tec hnic al and resourc es. They impressed Mr Low and Mr Leow that they were very knowledgeable about the business of generating elec tric al power in Andhra Pradesh and that they knew the relevant authorities and personnel involved and the c riteria for selec tion proc ess by APSEB for power projec ts. 

19     Mr Brake, who was at the material time the President of the defendants, made a presentation at the meeting about the defendants’ ability to arrange the financ ing for the Projec t. He stated that he had already spoken to the financ ial institutions and c onsultants before meeting the plaintiffs and he expressed c onfidenc e in being able to ac hieve Financ ial Closure within a short time frame. He went further and assured the plaintiffs’ representatives that in c ase of delay the defendants were able do balanc e sheet financ ing. 

20     In the end, the plaintiffs and the defendants agreed to develop the Projec t jointly with the defendants having the majority equity and c ontrol in the Projec t c ompany. It was also agreed that the Engineering and Proc urement Contrac t be awarded to Atlantic Seaboard Industries Ltd (“ASIL”), a subsidiary of the defendants. The parties entered into a Joint Venture Agreement dated 18 June 

1997\. They also entered into another agreement of the same date. Both agreements are referred to as “the June Agreements”. 


21     Under the June agreements it was expressly agreed that if the Government of Andhra Pradesh guarantee and/or the Fuel Linkage Lic enc e shall not be issued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh Government and/or APSEB within 60 days from the date of the June Agreements, “both parties will use their best endeavours to proc ure their issue.” It was c lear that the issue of the Fuel Linkage Lic enc e was extensively disc ussed by the parties during the negotiations and that they had resolved this important issue by agreeing to do their best to obtain it. 

22     Under the June Agreements the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs c ertain amounts inc luding an amount of over US$5.42 million after financ ing c losings under the engineering, proc urement and c onstruc tion (“EPC”) agreements and to proc ure the financ ing doc uments and over agreements to be exec uted within 120 days from 18 June 1997. 

23     In addition to the June Agreements, several other side agreements were entered into on 18 June 1997. The plaintiffs agreed to award to ASIL the projec t management c ontrac t in the sum of US$1.0 million. Sec ondly, they also agreed in respec t of the sharing of savings from the EPC Contrac t and other matters inc luding a provision for an allowanc e of US$250,000 for projec t administration in India. Thirdly, the plaintiffs and ASIl agreed, in respec t of the sharing of the differenc e in c ost of US$4,000,000 per Barge Mounted Power Plant amounting to an entitlement of the plaintiffs to c laim a sum of US$4,000,000.00. 

24     There was some delay in the c hoic e of Projec t Company in the Joint Venture under the June Agreements. Eventually it was dec ided to have a c ompany named EPS Oakwell Power Limited (“EOPL”) as the Projec t Company. The PPAs were then assigned to EOPL. Unfortunately, the delay c aused the delay in the issue of the GOAP Guarantee. 

25     Notwithstanding the delay, during whic h the plaintiffs had to deal direc tly with APSEB, GOAP and other authorities, it was also c lear on the evidenc e that from the defendants’ entry in June 1997 into the joint venture, the plaintiffs were dealing out of nec essity with the third party relevant authorities on behalf of the joint venture whic h, during that relevant period, was effec tively under the c ontrol of the defendants. 

26     Unfortunately, the defendants did not meet the deadlines in the June Agreements. 

**The 17 October 1997 Agreements** 

27     Both parties gave evidenc e of their perc eptions of the diffic ulties whic h they had enc ountered sinc e the June Agreements. I need not traverse those areas of differenc es, in whic h allegations and c ounter-allegations are made, as they entered into two agreements known as the Cooperation Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement both dated 17 Oc tober 1997 (“ the Agreements”). 

28     Under the 1997 Agreements, the defendants agreed to subsc ribe for 87.5% of the shares in EOPL , the Indian generating c ompany. The plaintiffs would subsc ribe for 12.5% shares in the c ompany. 

29     The highlights of the Agreements, whic h were emphasized during the hearing, are these. First, under c lause 4.2, the defendants agreed to replac e the deposit that sec ured the bank guarantee issued by the plaintiffs in favour of the APSEB (“the Bank Guarantee”) by 31 Oc tober 1997 and subsequently c ause renewals of the Bank Guarantee. 

30     Sec ondly, under c lause 4.4, the defendants, as partial c onsideration for (i) the reimbursement 


of the plaintiffs’ expenses in the development of the Power Purc hase Agreements signed between the plaintiffs and APSEB on 31 Marc h 1997 (“PPAs”) and the Projec t; (ii) the plaintiffs’ c ovenants and undertakings in the Agreement, agreed to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of US$5,424,500.00 as soon as possible after the date of the Financ ial Closure under the EPC Agreements but in any event not later than 30 days from that date. 

31     The third highlight of the Agreements is this. Under c lause 4.5, the defendants agreed that it would within 120 days of the date of the Co-operation Agreement, i.e. 17 Oc tober 1997, c ause the Financ ial Doc uments, the Shareholders’ Agreement and the EPC Agreements to be exec uted; and proc ure the Financ ial Closure of the Projec t. It was further agreement that if the defendants failed to fulfill the undertaking given in Clause 4.5 it would pay to the plaintiffs all suc h liquidated damages and penalties as the plaintiffs may bec ome liable to pay under the terms of the PPAs. It should be noted that the payment of any liquidated damages did not relieve the defendants from its obligation to c ause the Financ ing Doc uments, the Shareholders’ Agreement and the EPC agreement to be exec uted. 

32     I should now draw attention to some of the terms of the Shareholders Agreement. First, the defendants agreed that it shall within 120 days of the date of the Shareholders’ Agreement (i) lend or c ause to be lent to EOPL, and on a non-rec ourse basis with respec t to the other Shareholders, the sum of US$176,859,500 being 85% of the agreed budgeted c osts for the performanc e of the EPC Agreements; and (ii) proc ure the Financ ial Closure of the Projec t. It was also agreed that the aforesaid undertakings by the defendants would be delayed by the number of days of any delay attributable to either (a) delays in obtaining Fuel Linkage Alloc ation from the appropriate third parties and/or (b) delays in obtaining the duly exec uted Government of Andhra Pradesh Guarantee, provided suc h delay is not c aused by the defendants. 

33     In Dec ember 1997, the plaintiffs by way of ac c ommodation agreed with the plaintiffs’ suggestion to the c hange of fuel from furnac e oil to naptha and for c hange of tec hnology from Diesel Generating Set to Combined Cyc le Gas Turbine system. 

34     On 13 February 1998 the parties signed an agreement in whic h it was agreed that in view of the defendants’ failure to proc ure Financ ial Closure of the Projec t, the defendants be granted a 30 day extension. The plaintiffs’ rights were reserved. Further extensions were reluc tantly agreed to by the plaintiffs up to 1 September 1998. 

**Disputes and the Settlement Agreement** 

35     Disputes arose between the parties on the Agreements. On 8 July 1998, the defendants formally requested the plaintiffs to reduc e its c ompensation under the Co-operation Agreement by 50% stating that the defendants were c onc erned about its own ability to ac hieve Financ ial Closure of the Projec t without the partic ipation of CMS Asia (“CMS”). It c ited a number of reasons. For example, the defendants referred to the need to c hange the tec hnology from diesel sets to gas turbines was due to the requirements of the potential financ iers of the Projec t, who parties had identified to be Canada’s Export Development Corporation and Fanc e’s Cofac e. Sec ondly, the defendants. The defendants also mentioned that it was keen to get the agreement of CMS, whose group was at that time the only independent power produc er in the world generating elec tric ity in India, to share a 50% interest in all of the defendants’ present and future projec ts. In response, the plaintiffs pointed to the defendants’ failure to ac hieve the Financ ial Closure of he Projec ts as required by Clause 4.5 of the CoOperation Agreement and Clause 8.1.(b) of the Shareholders Agreement. Under the Co-operation Agreement the defendants had agreed to provide a replac ement sec urity for the c ash deposit/guarantees maintained by the plaintiffs as c ollateral for the Bank Guarantees issued in favour 


of APSEB for the guarantee of due performanc e of the obligations under the two Power Purc hase Agreements both dated 31 Marc h 1999 (“PPAs”). The defendants had failed to do so as late as August 1998. 

36     By its letter of 7 August, 1998 the plaintiffs gave notic e that the defendants had repudiated the Agreements. 

37     The matter was to proc eed to arbitration. In the midst of the c laims and c ross c laims, Mr Cassina, the then CEO of the defendants, broac hed the subjec t of a settlement. 

38     Negotiations began. Eac h party had its own perc eptions of the fac tors whic h were in operation before the Settlement Agreement. I should start by stating that around the end of September, l998 both sides ac c epted that in princ iple the settlement would take the shape of the defendants buying out the plaintiffs’ entire interest in the Power Projec t. Both sides took steps to c onsider the plaintiffs’ 12.5% interest in EOPL, the PPAs and the plaintiffs’ expenditure for the Power Projec t. 

39     Ac c ording to Mr Leow, who dealt with Mr Cassina on the implementation of the several agreement between the parties on behalf of the plaintiffs, he c omputed that a total aggregate of about US$13.75 million was due from the defendants. It was from this sum that the method of payment by the defendants was worked out. The last tranc he of US$7.544 million was to be paid from the c ash flow, defined as “net profit after tax plus deprec iation and reserves”, from the Projec t. Ac c ording to Mr Leow, and I ac c ept his evidenc e, both parties did a c omputation based on this amount and c alc ulating the financ ial projec tions of the Projec t they worked bac kwards to arrive at an annual sum of about 6.25% of the projec ted c ash flow from a period of 5 years. That approac h would produc e the aggregate of US$7.544 million. 

40     Mr Leow said that at the point in time when parties were about to c onc lude the Settlement Agreement, he had c omputed the basis of the total c omputation that the plaintiffs expec ted to rec eive under the Settlement Agreement to be as follows. First, there would be the c ash upfront payment of US$3,015,000 plus US$2,790,000.00 c ash payment whic h would be pegged to Financ ial Closure. In addition, the plaintiffs would rec eive the sum of about US$5 million over the firs 5 years under the royalty arrangement arising out of the 6.25% per annum c omputation of the projec ted c ashflow of the Projec t. The total amount was US$11 million. This amount was c ommunic ated to Mr Cassina on 25 November 1998. To meet the diffic ulties of making c ash payments of the defendants, whic h were often repeated during the negotiations, the defendants indic ated that they were willing to ac c ept the defendants’ shares in lieu, whic h in the event they did. The c ashflow projec tions for the five possible sc enarios at the time of the Settlement Agreement, whic h formed the basis of the 6.25% c omputation, were eventually annexed to the Settlement Agreement. It was c ontemplated by both parties that the defendants would be able to pay the plaintiffs in c ash under the EPC c ontrac t whic h had been awarded to the defendants’ subsidiary, ASIL. I ac c ept the ac c ount of these matters as rec orded by Mr Low and Mr Leow 

41     The plaintiffs also knew that as the Original Promoter of the Projec t, it c ould not totally relinquish its interest in the Projec t. Therefore, it always maintained that it had to c omply with Indian laws whic h required the Original Promoter of the Projec t to retain some interest in the Projec t. As stated in terms in the Settlement Agreement, it was c learly ac c epted by the defendants that the plaintiffs c ould only relinquish its interest, entitlements and rights to the extent permitted under Indian laws. Those ‘interest, entitlements and rights’ inc luded the obligations the plaintiffs to whic h it was subjec t as Original Promoter of the Projec t and whic h c ould not be relinquished under Indian laws. 


42     The signific ant terms of the Settlement Agreement are as follows. 

43     By c lause 1.2.4 the defendants were to c ause the replac ement of the Bank Guarantee on or before 31 Marc h 1999 and whic h the plaintiffs, as between the two parties, had no obligation to renew upon expiry on that date. 

44     By c lause 1.3.1 the defendants shall pay to the plaintiffs a sum of US$2,790,000.00 within 30 days from the date of the first drawdown of the funds by the defendants and/or EOPL after the Financ ial Closure of the Projec t, failing whic h the net sum of US$2.79 million shall bec ome due and payable and owing to the plaintiffs and shall be payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs forthwith. 

45     By c lause 1.4.1 the defendants shall c ause (with the assistanc e of the plaintiffs on its best efforts) EOPL to pay to the plaintiffs an annual sum equal to 6.25% of the ac tual c ash available for foreign repatriation, as defined by the Financ ial Analysis Model whic h along with the 5 possible sc enarios are annexed as Appendix A to the Settlement Agreement, based on the ac tual c onditions during the ac tual operation of the Projec t at the end of eac h financ ial year of EOPL for eac h of the 5 years after the Commerc ial Operation Date (”COD”) of the Projec t in US dollars within 75 days of the last month of eac h financ ial year of EOPL (“the 6.25% Annual Sum”). 

46     The payment of the 6.25% Annual Sum was to be by way of either of the two options set out. Firstly, the defendants were to c ause EOPL to issue preferenc e shares to the plaintiffs whic h would enable the plaintiffs to obtain the said payment or, sec ondly, the defendants were to c ause EOPL to pay to the plaintiffs as the said sum s tec hnic al and c onsultanc y fees. By the same c lause, the option to be exerc ised must be mutually agreed to in writing and determined within 60 days from the date of the Settlement Agreement or within suc h extended period as may be mutually agreed. 

47     By c lause 3.1, subjec t to the fulfillment by eac h of the parties of their respec tive obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the terms and c onditions c ontained therein, the parties agreed that the Settlement Agreement shall c onstitute the full, final and c omplete agreement and resolution of all disputes arising from the plaintiffs’ notic e of arbitration dated 6 September 1998 and the defendants’ letter to the plaintiffs of 19 September 1998. 

48     In the afternoon of the first day of trial, on 5 May 2003, parties before me, after some enc ouragement from me, agreed to narrow the issues. As it turned out, the defendants were c onstrained to agree bec ause its exaggerated c ounter releases were without merit. Their agreement was also stated in the c orrespondenc e between their respec tive firms of solic itors. Both parties agreed that in view of the agreement, the disputes will assume that the Settlement Agreement was operative and that all c ross examination would be c onfined to post Settlement Agreement issues. This approac h c onfirmed parties would only seek to rely on what was agreed under the Settlement Agreement. By c lause 3.2 parties had agreed that upon exec ution of the Settlement Agreement, the Agreements stood terminated and they unc onditionally released and disc harged eac h other from all obligations, rights and c onditions c ontained in and arising under or in c onnec tion with the Agreements. 

49     I turn to the post Settlement Agreement events. The defendants c ontinued to manage and c ontrol the Projec t, as it did after the June Agreements. Although the defendants were to issue and deliver 1,850,000 of its shares to the plaintiffs in lieu of the payment of US$3,015,000.00, by the time the said shares were delivered to the plaintiffs, their market value was about US$2 million. Not that anything in issue turn on this fac t, the plaintiffs stressed to me the fac t that by the time the plaintiffs managed to sell the shares, they only fetc hed approximately US$255,000.00. Shareholders must ac c ept that value of their shareholdings c ould rise, stagnate or fall. 


50     On or about 21 June 1999, some 6 months after the Settlement Agreement, Mr Low was informed by Mr Amarc hand that he had been approac hed by an Indian entity, known as Konaseema Power Corporation Ltd (“KPCL”, whic h is an entity within the VBC Group. By a letter of that date, Mr Rama Rao (“Mr Rao”) wrote a letter under the letterhead of VBC Ferro Alloys Ltd, part of the VBC Group, to Mr Amarc hand expressing interest in taking up the Projec t, “possibly with ultimate takeover.” He asked for some c ruc ial information about the projec t, suc h as the tariff details finally ac c epted. Mr Cassina representing the defendants ac c epted that any c onsideration by the defendants about the offer c ould not move ahead with the plaintiffs to be “by (their) side”. The plaintiffs were positively responsive, as it had been waiting for Financ ial Closure by the defendants whic h had long passed the due date. 

51     On or about 16 July 1999, representatives from the plaintiffs being Mr Low and Mr Leow, Mr Cassina from the defendants met for the first time with Mr Raoand Mr Janga Kamesware Sarma (“Mr Sama”) of the VBC Group together with Mr Amarc hand who was then Managing Direc tor of EOPL. Perhaps, it should be noted in parenthesis that Mr Sarma later gave evidenc e on behalf of the plaintiffs about the negotiations leading to the July 2001 Agreements between the plaintiffs and the VBC Group, the status of the Projec t as at the date of this trial and the fac tual evidenc e in relation to the plaintiffs’ bid for the Projec t. 

52     On 16 July 1999 the plaintiffs signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the defendants, EOPL and KPCL (“the MOU”). The plaintiffs signed the MOU against the indemnity from the defendants of even date that expressly made c lear that the defendants’ obligations to the plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement was to remain unaffec ted. The MOU rec orded the desire of parties to join in the development of the Projec t with EOPL to be renamed Konseema Oakwell Power Ltd (“KEOPL”) as the vehic le for the development and ownership of the Projec t. VBC Ferro Alloys Limited also gave the plaintiffs an indemnity to the like effec t. 

53     Following the entry of the VBC Group into the Projec t, the defendants only wrote to the plaintiffs twic e to inform the plaintiffs about the progress of the Projec t. In Oc tober and September 2000 Mr Low wrote to Mr Rao to ask for information. 

**Defendants’ entry into the VBC Agreement** 

54     An interesting piec e of information was furnished by one Mr Ramesh Kumar Naroola (“Mr Naroola”). Mr Naroola was at all material times the c onsultant and legal advisor of Aarken Consultants Pvt Ltd. After having served the plaintiffs, it transpired that later, as from Oc tober, 1999, he bec ame a direc tor of the defendants. 

55     Mr Naroola informed Mr Low that a sum of US$500,000.00 would be offered towards satisfac tion of the defendants’ obligations to the plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement provided the plaintiffs agree to give a release and indemnity to the defendants and the VBC Group. The plaintiffs were at that time rather strapped for c ash and Mr Low agreed if the amount was paid in advanc e and subjec t to the plaintiffs’ prior approval of the drafts of the requested release and indemnity in favour of the defendants and the VBC Group. 

56     It was not in dispute that the plaintiffs were not paid and it must be c onc luded that this was a passing distrac tion. 

57     The defendants entered into an agreement dated 10 August 2000 with the VBC Group (“the VBC Agreement”). A c opy of the VBC Agreement was made available to the plaintiffs only on 22 November 2002 after the plaintiffs had given notic e of produc tion of the doc ument. 


58     In Dec ember, 2000 Mr Cassina and Mr Naroola visited Mr Low in the plaintiffs’ offic e in Singapore. Mr Low was expec ting payment, pursuant to the offer c onveyed by Mr Naroola, as well as details of the agreement entered into between the defendants and the VBC Group. Mr Cassina offered neither. Mr Low terminated the meeting and asked the two gentlemen to leave. 

59     In January 2001 Mr Low disc overed from the financ ial statements of the defendants, a listed c ompany, that the c ompany had divested or agreed to divest their interest in the Projec t Company and in the Projec t. In the published Consolidated Financ ial Statements of the defendants for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998. The Consolidated Statement of Loss and Defic it disc losed that the end of year defic its for 1998, 1999 and 2000 were Canadian $6.5 million, $14.5 million and $17 million respec tively. 

60     The following notes to the Consolidated Financ ial Statements are noteworthy. 

61     In respec t of the ac quisition of KEOPL it was rec orded that effec tive February 25, 1999 the defendants ac quired a 100% interest in KEOPL, a power Projec t in Andhra Pradesh, India. 

62     The power Projec t had c hanged to a 459 Mega Watt (“MW”) c ombined c yc le natural gas powered land based projec t being developed in the State of Andhra Pradesh, India. “At June 30, 2000 the development of the Projec t was sponsored by (defendants’) 100% owned subsidiary KEOPL. Financ ial and operation support is being provided by the VBC Group..., an Indian power produc er, under the terms of VBC Agreement dated July 16, 19999. The VBC Agreement outlined the terms under whic h VBC would c ause to financ e the c onstruc tion of the Projec t, reimburse (defendants) for its development c osts and replac e (defendants’) performanc e guarantee, lodged with the Andhra Pradesh State Elec tric ity Board. The VBC Agreement also outlined how VBC would have the right to subsc ribe for 75% of KEOPL by funding 79% of the required equity at financ ial c losing of the Projec t.” (brac kets and substitutes are added, in this and the following paragraph). 

63     The next paragraph stated thus: “On August 10, 2000, the Company (i.e. the defendants), VBC and KEOPL replac ed the VBC Agreement with a revised agreement (the “Revised VBC Agreement”) under whic h KEOPL would c apitalize Indian Rupees (“INR” 204,227,000, approximately $6,600,000, by the issue of 15,847,200 equity shares at INR 10 per share and 4,575,000 preferenc e shares at INR 10 per share to the defendants for expenses inc urred by the (defendants) for and on behalf of KEOPL.” 

64     Under the terms of the Revised VBC Agreement, KEOPL is c ommitted to redeem the (defendants’) 4,575,000 preferenc e shares at INR 10 per share and VBC is c ommitted to purc hase 5,195,000 equity shares of KEOPL owned by the (defendants) at INR 10 per share on or before Dec ember 31, 2000, for a total c ash c onsideration of approximately Canadian $3,100,000. After the payment of this amount (the defendants) will have been diluted to a 30% minority interest in the Projec t. 

65     Under events subsequent to the latest year ended financ ial statements, it was noted that on 10 November 2000 the defendants rec overed Canadian $1.7 million related to the Andhra Pradesh Projec t. 

66     The plaintiffs lodged its written protest with the defendants for not having involved and informed its management of the Revised VBC Agreement, a c opy of whic h it asked the defendants to provide. The plaintiffs did not rec eive any substantive reply from the defendants. 

67     On 5 Marc h 2001 and 16 April 2001 the plaintiffs wrote to the Andhra Pradesh Power 


Transmission Corporation (“APTRANSCO”), formerly known as APSEB and the Government of Andhra Pradesh (“GOAP”). It asked that as promoter of the Projec t it be kept apprised of developments in the Projec t and pointed out that the plaintiffs’ c onsent as the original promoter should be obtained before the 5 items mentioned in its letter of 5 Marc h 2001 to both APTRANSCO and GOAP. It is not nec essary to dwell into these c ollateral matters save to note that neither authority responded in any way whic h c onc eivably damaged or injured the interest of the defendants in the Projec t Company or in the Projec t. In my view, the plaintiffs were perfec tly entitled to c omplain of the c onduc t of various parties sinc e they had ac ted without regard to the interest of the plaintiffs. 

**The Agreements with the VBC Group/KEOPL** 

68     Not unexpec tedly, the VBC Group began to talk to the plaintiffs. They held meetings on 30 May, 31 May, 1 June and 2 June of 2001. Both sides signed the minutes of the several meetings. Several items were agreed upon. 

69     Both the VBC Group and the plaintiffs entered into the Agreement of Mutual Understanding and Indemnity (“AMUI”), Tec hnology Transfer, Collaboration and Lic enc e Agreement (“TTCLA”), Shareholders Agreement and other doc uments all dated 4 July 2001. The c laim against the VBC Group was to be settled by the payment of a sum of US$2 million in respec t of past tec hnic al servic es and any ongoing tec hnic al servic es and advic e, if required, whic h the plaintiffs rendered for the benefit of the Projec t Company sinc e 1995. The other US$4 million was payable in respec t of tec hnic al servic es in the event that they were to be required for the Projec t Company after the signing of the TTLCA. The Shareholders Agreement between the two parties ac knowledged the entry of the VBC Group into the Projec t and to rec ord that the plaintiffs remained as Original Promoter of the Projec t. It was required by APTRANSCO before it gave its assent to the amended PPAs. 

70     As part of the deal, the plaintiffs assigned to Metc omp Engineering (Singapore) Pte Limited (“Metc omp”) the right to sue the defendants as an agent/nominee of the VBC Group and KEOPL. Mr Rao represented to Mr Low that Metc omp was the agent/nominee of the VCB Group and KEOPL. 

71     In the event, KEOPL only paid the sum of US$350,000 to the plaintiffs. Up to date, it has defaulted in the repayment of the remaining sum. The plaintiffs dec lared that KEOPL was in breac h of the AMUI and demanded payment of the entire balanc e sum of US$1.65 million. 

72     By mutual agreement made on 1 July 2002 between the VBC Group, the agent/nominee Metc omp and the plaintiffs, the assignment was treated by the parties as if it was never entered into. It was ac knowledged by Metc omp that the assignment “lapsed in its entirely due to various ac ts of omission and c ommission by KEOPL, KPCL and the VCB Group”. The plaintiffs c laim that there is an outstanding amount for the sum of US$1,650,000 plus interest due and owing from KEOPL to the plaintiffs. But that is not a matter before me. 

**Plaintiffs’ acceptance of Breach** 

73     The plaintiffs ac c epted the breac h by the defendants and treated the Settlement Agreement as terminated. In their letter of 22 July 2002 sent to the defendants, it reiterated that in January 2001, it c ame to know of an agreement c onc luded between the defendants and the VBC Group on 10 August 2000, or referred to earlier as the VBC Agreement. The plaintiffs noted that the defendants under the VBC Agreement would dilute its interest in KEOPL to a minority 30% upon rec eipt of a total c ash c onsideration of Canadian $3.1 million from the VBC Group before 31 Dec ember 2000. The mec hanism of payments to the defendants inc luded the c apitalisation of approximately Canadian $6. million by the issue of equity and preferenc e shares in KEOPL. 


74     The plaintiffs further asserted that by virtue of the VBC Agreement, the defendants evinc ed an intention not to perform its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. By effec tively disengaging itself from KEOPL and the Projec t, it would no longer be in the position to ensure Financ ial Closure of the Projec t, to draw down funds or have any c ontrol of it. The plaintiffs pointed out that sinc e the defendants rendered itself inc apable and/or were unwilling to disc harge its obligations to the plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement, its liability to make payment to the plaintiffs pursuant to c lauses 1.3 and 1.4 of the Settlement Agreement had arisen. The plaintiffs, as noted earlier, expressly ac c epted the defendants’ repudiation of the Settlement Agreement. It therefore demanded from the defendants the payment of US$2.70 million and the 6.25% Annual Sum. 

**The defendants’ counterclaim** 

75     In response, the defendants alleged that the Settlement Agreement had bec ome “impossible of performanc e or otherwise frustrated”, due to unilateral measures taken by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and/or its State bodies. They therefore sought the return of US$3,015,000 being the value of the shares transferred to the plaintiffs in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The defendants also sought the return of all moneys paid to the plaintiffs pursuant to or in c onnec tion with the Settlement Agreement. This inc luded the sum of US$750,000.00 paid to the 

order of the plaintiffs to disc harge c ertain debts owing from the plaintiffs to various 3rd parties in Andhra Pradesh, India in July 1999. 

76     In the alternative, the defendants c ontended that even if the Settlement Agreement has not been frustrated, it disputed the plaintiffs’ c laims on the ground that the plaintiffs had plainly by its c onduc t and its letters to various parties repudiated the Settlement Agreement. The defendants alleged that the plaintiffs after the Settlement Agreement had no right to determine how the Projec t and/or KEOPL should be run. At the same time, the plaintiffs were under an implied duties to meet its formal legal requirements under Indian law and not to jeopardise the Projec t, nor to interfere in any way with how the defendants had c hosen to run KEOPL and/or the use of the PPAs. Those obligations c ontinued despite the entry of the VBC Group into the Projec t and the Projec t Company. It therefore c omplained about the plaintiffs’ letters written to the VBC Group asserting c laims against the defendants. The defendants also c omplained against the letters written by the plaintiffs to the GOAP and APSEB (later known as “APTRANSCO”) in whic h the plaintiffs rec ited their disputes with the defendants and in whic h it asserted and reserved its rights as the original Promoter of the Projec t. It seems to me diffic ult to see how those letters, whic h asserted the rights of the plaintiffs, albeit rather forc efully, c ould ‘jeopardise’ the Projec t or the relationship between the VBC Group and the defendants and the attitude of the relevant Indian authorities. The plaintiffs were entitled to keep the Indian authorities informed as it was still bound to ensure the proper performanc e of the Projec t and the PPAs. 

**The Issues:** 

**(1) Did defendants breached its obligations to achieve Financial Closure?** 

77     The first issue I will address is the question whether the defendants had breac hed its obligation to ac hieve Financ ial Closure. It is unquestionable that the defendants, when it held 87.5% of the shares in EOPL, and c ertainly when it held 100% under the Settlement, it had agreed to ac hieve Financ ial Closure. Upon the happening of that event, the defendants would be obliged to make the payments under the Settlement Agreement. 

78     In my view of the evidenc e, the defendants had a reasonable time within whic h to ac hieve Financ ial Closure. The operational c ontext of the Projec t in Dec ember 1998 was basic ally as follows. 


Andhra Pradesh had been “a state whic h is more of the role of independent power produc ers”. Mr Murthy (DW7), the expert witness c alled by the defendants, agreed. The Government of India had also been liberalising the power sec tor. Furnac e Oil was de-c ontrolled in July 1998. The limit on the amount of financ ing from Indian financ ial institutions was removed. I ac c ept Mr Kishore’s (PW9’s) evidenc e on the state of the power sec tor in India. He opined as follows. The parameters of the initial PPAs made the Projec t viable. The request by the defendants through EOPL for a c hange of tec hnology was approved by APSEB in May 1998. The c hanged parameters were designed to solve the c onc erns about the fac t that it was only for the initial 7 year period that the Fuel Linkage had been granted. In his opinion, whic h I ac c ept, the c hanged parameters were plainly viable. 

79     He made the important point that the impac t of there being Fuel Linkage for only 7 years ended (on the worst c ase) with the de-c ontrol in July 1998, and so had no effec t in the first half of 

1999\. The defendants had at all material managed this disappoint, whic h was overc ome, and I do not see any forc e in their repeated harking bac k about the shorter Fuel Linkage Lic enc e. 

80     Mr Kishore further opined that the re-organisation of APSEN into APSTRANSCO and APGENCO (responsible for the power generation side of things) was in fac t a positive move and c ould not have impeded the Projec t. 

81     He also c onfirmed that there wee enough Indian and foreign lenders and investors willing to lend and invest in power projec ts in India generally and in Andhra Pradesh in partic ular. 

82     Mr Kishore therefore c onc luded that “there was no valid reason why the defendants c ould not ac hieve Financ ial Closure within a reasonable period of the date of the Settlement Agreement, i.e. by 29 June 1999. By then the defendants would have had from Oc tober 1997 to about 279 June 1999 i.e. a period of 2 years to do so.” I am of the view that this c onc lusion by the total effec t of the evidenc e led before me. 

83     What had transpired was this. From 29 Dec ember 1998 until the entry of the VBC Group into the Projec t on 16 July 1999 it did not do anything at all to move the physic al progress of the Projec t forward. Mr Naroola (DW4) ac c epted in the c ourse of his c ross examination that the land was not ac quired nor was the c onstruc tion of the barges c ommenc ed in this period. In this Projec t, land had to be purc hased although BargeMounted Power Plants were involved. I do not ac c ept the exc use of the defendants that it did not take any of these steps pending the signing of the modified PPAs. 

84     The defendants also did not ensure or c ause the c ommenc e c onstruc tion of the barge whic h EOPL was required to do within 8 months from 31 Marc h 1997. Mr Brake of defendants admitted that c onstruc tion of the barges never started. It was remarkable that APSEB was told before 10 November 1998 about visits of the c ompany offic ials to the doc kyard in Canada to inspec t the barges. It was not surprising that the c laim was dismissed as “bogey” by the Sec retary (Energy, GOAP. In a report dated 29 July 1998 from EOPL to all its foreign direc tors, Mr Amarc hand reported that EOPL was in default of fulfilling that obligation under the PPAs. He noted that APSEB’s perc eption of the progress made by EOPL to implement the Projec t was very poor. At the same time, Mr Amarc hand reported that the Projec t might not suffer if EOPL was able to prove substantial progress in Financ ial Closure and c onstruc tion of the barges before 31 July 1998. 

85     I find that after July 1998 the Fuel Linkage was no longer an issue after the dec ontrol of furnac e oil in July 1998. Contrary to Mr Cassina’s assertion, the PPAs did not expire under their own terms. The position was that either party under Artic le 6.3 may give notic e in writing to terminate the PPA if Financ ial Closure did not oc c ur within 30 days of the notic e. 


86     In the event, for the Projec t itself, the VBC Group was able to ac hieve Financ ial Closure in Princ iple on 30 Dec ember 1999 on the basis of the PPAs as approved and agreed in May 1998 with a revised gestation period of 16 months. This approval from the Industrial Development Bank of India, albeit in princ iple, demonstrated the reasonable period it would take for the defendants to ac hieve Financ ial Closure. 

87     In my judgment, by the end of June 1999 the defendants were in breac h of its obligations to ac hieve Financ ial Closure. It was therefore a matter of immense relief to the defendants that the VBC Group took an interest in the Projec t and took on the lead role in the Projec t following the Agreement of 16 July 1999. 

**(2) Did the defendants breach the Settlement Agreement by its entry into the VBC Agreement of 10 August 2000?** 

88     On the evidenc e, it was quite c lear that Mr Cassina on behalf of the defendants had obtained the agreement of the VBC Group to inc rease the payment to US$4.463 million. He told the VBC Group that the defendants had to pay off the plaintiffs in satisfac tion of the latter’s right, title and interest under the Settlement Agreement. PW10 Mr Sama, a direc tor of KEOPL and a former member of APSEB, gave evidenc e on the negotiations leading to the entry of the VBC Group into the Projec t, the July 2001 Agreement between the plaintiffs and the VBC Group and the c urrent status of the Projec t. He stated as follows: 

 “Under the MOA, the VBC Group was to pay a sum of INR 141,000,000 to the defendants for the ac quisition of all of the defendants’ equity and majority c ontrol of KEOPL. The defendants’ Mr Cassina, in or around May 2000, started insisting for an additional amount apparently to pay to the plaintiffs in satisfac tion of the defendants’ payment obligations to the plaintiffs under the Settlement Agreement exec uted between them. The spec ific payment obligations, whic h the defendants had towards the plaintiffs, were never revealed to the VBC Group. Eventually, a total sum of INR 211,000,000 was to be paid to the defendants and my understanding was that this would enable the defendants to pay the plaintiffs and proc ure the indemnity/release in favour of the VBC Group and KEOPL from the plaintiffs.” 

89     Mr Cassina, however, in dealing with the plaintiffs, strung them along by a serious of untruthful statements. He told both Mr Low and Mr Leow that the VBC deal was a lousy deal, and taking advantage of the financ ial diffic ulties whic h the plaintiffs were fac ing, he c aused an invitation to treat to be staged by Mr Naroola. The defendants, through Mr Low, was prepared to ac c ept $500,000 and c onc lude the matter, onc e and all, provided payment was prompt. Mr Cassina turned bac k on this approac h. No agreement between them on the proposed payment of $500,000 was made. 

90     Then Mr Cassina, who has some legal bac kground, c ame upon the argument that the c hange in the Projec t with the reduc ed tariff and the various modific ations to the Projec t, sinc e the VBC Group c ame on board, were material c hanges of c irc umstanc es that had frustrated the Settlement Agreement. I shall shortly deal with this defenc e. Suffic e it to say at this stage that before this about-turn of Mr Cassina, Mr Low and Mr Leow in all fairness had expec ted to reduc e what was due to them under the Settlement Agreement, thinking that the defendants after its divestment to the VBC Group would get less than what it had expec ted had it c ontinued to c ontrol and operate the Projec t post the Settlement Agreement. The parties never got round to any disc ussion down that route bec ause Mr Cassina insisted that frustration of the Settlement Agreement had oc c urred in the c irc umstanc es I will address later. His unc ompromising attitude was that the defendants c ould rec eive all it will rec eive under the VBC Agreement, the plaintiffs must disgorge the shares in the defendants 


whic h it had rec eived in part payment under the Settlement Agreement, and the plaintiffs must make restitution of the sum of US$350,000 whic h it had rec eived from the VBC Group. 

91     I ac c ept the plaintiffs’ submission that the defendants repudiated the Settlement Agreement by entering into the 10 August 2000 Agreement with the VBC Group. It did not make provision to ensure that the plaintiffs’ right, title and interest under the Settlement Agreement and in the Projec t were satisfied. In its Financ ial Statements referred to earlier it asserted that the Settlement Agreement had been affec ted by a c hange of c irc umstanc es and also that the responsibility to pay the sums under the Settlement Agreement was that of the Projec t and not defendants’. As noted earlier, the defendants stated that the Projec t was required to pay the plaintiffs the 6.25% Annual Sum. By its divestment for the c onsideration of US$4., the defendants had unilaterally and entirely on its own volition disabled itself from being able to pay from the Projec t Funds, following the Financ ial Closure whic h they had failed to bring about. 

92     I also ac c ept the submission of the plaintiffs that the defendants, having divested its interest in KEOPL and the Projec t to the VBC Group and made it impossible for it to effec t Financ ial Closing and ac hieve the targeted Commerc ial Operation Date, is in breac h of he Settlement Agreement and is prec luded from relying on the non-happening of the event as an exc use for not making the payments under the Settlement Agreement. 

93     I was referred to the dec ision of the English Court of Appeal in _Boscome Athletic Football Club & Co Ltd v Manchester United Football Club Ltd_ (supra). Its judgment was delivered on 21 May 1980. In that c ase, the football c lub Manc hester United had bought a player from Bournemouth. The transfer pric e of £200,000 of whic h £175,000 was payable immediately on transfer and the remaining £25,000 was payable only after the player had sc ored 20 goals for Manc hester United. Manc hester United sold the player before he c ould sc ore the 20 goals. Manc hester United was ordered to pay the balanc e of the transfer fee bec ause it was in breac h of an implied term that Manc hester United would afford the player a reasonable opportunity of sc oring the 20 goals. The sale had deprived him of that opportunity and Manc hester United c ould not rely on the fac t that he had not sc ored 20 goals as the ground to resist payment. 

94     In any c ase, the plaintiffs further relies on the express term c ontained in c lause 14 of the Settlement Agreement, whereby both parties agreed to do or proc ure to be done all suc h further ac ts or things as might be nec essary to give effec t to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. In _Mackey v Dick_ [1880-1881] 6 App. Case 251, a seller sold a digging mac hine to the buyer on c ondition that the buyer would test the mac hine on an open surfac e in a designated plac e to asc ertain if it had the warranted rate of digging c apac ity. It was found as a fac t that the buyer had refused to let the mac hine be tested at the designated “open surfac e c utting”. Lord Blac kburn c onstrued the c ondition in the following terms at p. 263: “I think I may safely say, as a general rule, that where in a written c ontrac t it appears that both parties have agreed that something shall be done, whic h c annot effec tively be done unless both c onc ur in doing it, the c onstruc tion of the c ontrac t is that eac h agrees to do all that is nec essary to be done on this part for the c arrying out of that thing, though there may be no express words to that effec t. What is the part of eac h must depend on the c irc umstanc es.” 

95     In my judgment, the defendants were in breac h of the c ondition to do everything nec essary to bring about Financ ial Closing so that the plaintiffs would be duly paid ac c ording to the Settlement Agreement. The defendants are not allowed to walk away from his obligations by selling his rights under the Settlement Agreement, making it impossible for it to ac hieve Financ ial Closing and then relying on it as not triggering the obligation to pay the plaintiffs. 


**Frustration** 

96     It is not disputed that the test of frustration is what is desc ribed in Chitty On Contrac t (28th Ed 1999) at para 24-012: “If the literal words of the c ontrac tual promise were to be enforc ed in the c hanged c irc umstanc es, would performanc e involve a fundamental or radic al c hange from the obligation originally undertaken?” The promisor should be in a position to say that “It was not this that I promised to do” and it must be shown that there must be a c hange in the signific anc e of the obligation that the thing undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that c ontrac ted for: see _Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC_ [1956] AC 696. 

97     The defendants alleged that performanc e under the Settlement Agreement bec ame a radic ally different undertaking when the tariffs payable by APSEB under the PPAs were unilaterally reduc ed by the Government of India in late Dec ember 1999/ early January 2000. The Capac ity Charge was reduc ed from INR 1.5 to INR 0.94. KEOPL was forc ed to ac c ept lower tariffs or fac e c anc ellation. Ac c ording to Mr Sc ott Hargreaves (DW6), who gave evidenc e on behalf of the defendants on the financ ial impac t of a reduc tion in tariffs to projec t ec onomic s and the requirements of potential lenders and equity partic ipants, said that by reason of the reduc ed tariff, the Projec t was no longer ec onomic ally viable. He opined, for the reasons he gave, that the Projec t would be loss-making proposition for the next 11 years. In c onsequenc e, even if Financ ial Closing was ac hieved, the plaintiffs would have been entitled to nothing under the 6.25% Annual Sum, sinc e there would be no “Cash Flow for Foreign repatriation”. 

98     The defendants referred to the c onsequent inc rease in c apac ity from 2 x 100 MW to first 359 MW and later 445 MW, whic h KEOPL implemented and c ontended that the Projec t “bec ame even more of a venture not c ontemplated by the parties. 

99     As a matter of law, the defendants further c ontended that the Frustrated Contrac ts Ac t (Cap 115) applies in this c ase, sinc e the Settlement Agreement has “bec ome impossible of performanc e or been otherwise frustrated”: see sec tion 2(1). The defendants rely on sec tion 2(3) of the Ac t, whic h provides as follows: 

 “Where any party to the c ontrac t has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performanc e of the c ontrac t, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to whic h subsec tion (2) applies) before the time of disc harge, there shall be rec overable from him by that other party suc h sum (if any) not exc eeding the value of that benefit to the party obtaining it, as the c ourt c onsiders just, having regard to all the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, and in partic ular 

 (a) the amount of any expenses inc urred before the time of disc harge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performanc e of the c ontrac t, inc luding any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuanc e of the c ontrac t and retained or rec overable by that party under subsec tion (2); and 

 (b) the effec t, in relation to that benefit, of the c irc umstanc es giving rise to the frustration of the c ontrac t.” 

100    The defendants by way of c ounterc laim sought to rec over the value of all benefits rec eived whic h it estimates at US$3,805,000.00, as well s all sums that may be due or available to the defendants as a result of frustration. These sums, it submitted, c omprised the valuable benefit of US$3.015 million given to the plaintiffs under c lause 1.1.1 of the Settlement Agreement and the sum of US$790,0000 paid as a result of the agreements of July 1999. 


101    It should be noted that the defendants c laimed that they “purc hased” all rights, entitlements and interest in the entire Projec t from the plaintiffs with payment to be made in terms of the Settlement Agreement. In these proc eedings, they c laimed the Settlement Agreement had been frustrated in law. But it was the self-same “rights, entitlements and interest” whic h the defendants had sold to the VBC Group first under the MOA and later by the 10 August 2000 Agreement. Under the 10 August 2000 Agreement the defendants, during the trial of this ac tion, was still c laiming in the Arbitration against the VBC Group for sums allegedly owing to it under the 10 August 2000 Agreement. Frustration in law of the Settlement Agreement must similarly disc harge the 10 August Agreement and it is c lear that the defendants are not permitted to approbate and reprobate. 

102    The allegations that the Projec t would be unprofitable and Financ ing Closing would not be ac hievable are not, in my judgement, made out. The c hange in tariff must not and should not be c onsidered in isolation. It was agreed to by KEOPL, whic h was c ontrolled by the defendants at all material times. KEOPL, in exc hange for c apac ity inc rease from 200 to 445 MW, agreed to the lower tariff. In addition, it was proved that c heaper equipment would be used to operate natural gas. Contrary to the assertions of the defendants, the Industrial Development Bank of India and other lenders c onsidered the Projec t (as modified) suitable for financ ing. 

103    Even if the defendants were right about the c hange in tariffs c ausing the Projec t to be unprofitable, of whic h I am not persuaded, the defendants took the risk whic h passed to it and whic h it assumed to take at the time of the Settlement Agreement. 

104    Further whatever happened to any aspec t of the Projec t from the time of the Settlement Agreement, the defendants are bound to pay the plaintiffs in ac c ordanc e with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 

105    The defendants plac ed relianc e on the views of the Indian Central Elec tric ity Authority (“CEA”) whic h had advised the Government of India to advise GOAP to c all for fresh c ompetitive bidding for the Projec t as it was of the view that the Projec t should not c ontinue as the old projec t with modific ations. The views of CEA, in my judgment, do not c onfirm the existenc e of the alleged ‘frustrating events’. CEA gave its views in its advisory c apac ity, having regard to the interest of the Government and the public ; it was not pronounc ing on the respec tive rights of the parties under the Settlement Agreement. It did not appear that the Government of India took to heart the views of CEA as it did not advise GOAP, and GOAP at its elec tion, did not c anc el the Projec t (as modified). The evidenc e of Mr VVRK Rao (PW4)l, the retired Chairman of CEA, formed the basis of these c onc lusions of the c ourt. 

106    In my judgment, there is nothing radic ally different about the obligation, before or after the c hange in tariffs. The Projec t that was originally awarded to the plaintiffs is still the same projec t (although with modific ations) as that presently being developed by the VBC Group. 

**Conclusion** 

107    Before I deal with the damages and amounts payable to the plaintiffs by the defendants, I should set out the defendants’ position in relation to KEOPL and the Projec t. The defendants had obtained the benefit under the Settlement Agreement and had on 10 August 2000 sold it to the VBC Group. The extent of the defendants’ measure of loss (if any) is the remaining c laim of INR113,482,000 less the value of the 11,348,200 shares in KEOPL in respec t of the 10 August 2000 Agreement. The value of the shares in KEOPL derives its value from the Projec t, whic h by all ac c ounts, is now “poised to take off”. 


108    In the premises, I make the following orders: 

(1) the defendants pay the sum of US2.7 million less the sums of US$790,000 and US$350,000.00 whic h latter two sums I had referred to earlier; 

(2) the defendants pay damages to the plaintiffs in respec t of the 6.25% Annual Sum under the Settlement Agreement the sum of US$2,560,210, assessed as at the date of the 10 August 2000 Agreement. 

109    The defendants’ c ounterc laims are ac c ordingly dismissed with c osts. 

110    The defendants has also prayed for interest from the date of breac h to judgment, c osts on an indemnity basis as set out in c lause 8.3 of the Settlement Agreement. 

111    Counsel for the plaintiffs further submitted that the plaintiffs are entitled to rec over the c osts in respec t of the preSettlement Agreement c laims that were dropped by agreement at the beginning of the trial. In this c onnec tion, it should be noted that the defendants had in its c ounterc laim filed on 8 November 2002 partic ularised its damages at a staggering US$174 million whic h inc luded sums c laimed in the dispute prior to the Settlement Agreement. The c ounterc laim was reduc ed to US$ million. It was only on the sec ond day of the trial that the issues were narrowed and what c laims were dropped were indic ated. I shall need further partic ulars and submissions on these issues. Parties are therefore direc ted to make further written submissions on these outstanding issues and also tender together, if possible, or separately, a draft Order of Court c ontaining the terms whic h are already ordered by me in this judgment.
