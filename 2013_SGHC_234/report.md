**Choo Han Teck J:** 

1       The parties applied to rec ord a c onsent interloc utory judgment with damages to be assessed. I dec lined to rec ord the settlement and told c ounsel that I will be referring this c ase to the AttorneyGeneral for his ac tion. The grounds are as follows. 

2       The plaintiff was driving a motor van about 7.30am on 26 May 2010 when a vehic le driven by the defendant c ollided against the plaintiff’s van. He c laimed that his vehic le was stationary when the defendant’s bus c ollided against the rear of his vehic le, whic h then c ollided against the c ar in front. The c laim by the driver of that vehic le has sinc e been settled. The plaintiff and his passenger both c laimed to be injured. The plaintiff’s passenger sued the defendant in the magistrate’s c ourt, joining the plaintiff as a third party. That c laim was settled with a c onsent judgment in whic h the liability was apportioned 95% against the defendant and 5% against the plaintiff. 

3       The plaintiff then c ommenc ed this ac tion against the defendant, c laiming 100% liability. The plaintiff obtained an interim payment of $100,000. Subsequently, the plaintiff applied in Summons No 6172 of 2012 for a sec ond interim payment. The applic ation was dismissed by Assistant Registrar Miss Sngeeta Devi (“AR Devi”) on 14 Dec ember 2012. A medic al report on the plaintiff’s injury dated 1 Oc tober 2010 by an orthopaedic surgeon Dr Peng desc ribed the plaintiff’s injury as “the impression is nec k sprain, c hest c ontusion and lumbar disc protrusion and spondylolisthesis”. It is noted that the plaintiff had two surgeries in 2011; one in July and the other in Oc tober. 

4       The appeal in respec t of AR Devi’s dec ision was sc heduled for hearing about a week before the start of the trial before me. The trial as to liability was fixed for hearing on 4 Marc h 2013. It was then that I asked why the plaintiff’s name was different in some previous doc uments filed. Counsel for the plaintiff, Miss Viviene Sandhu, then informed me that the plaintiff c hanged his name by deed poll on 25 February 2011 from Tan Poh Kim to Andy Tan Poh Weng. 

5       Mr Alvin Cheng, c ounsel for the defendant, said that the question of liability c annot be settled bec ause the plaintiff had admitted to being 5% liable in his passenger’s suit in the Magistrate Court so he c annot now c laim 100% against the defendant. Miss Sandhu objec ted to this defenc e bec ause she 


c laimed that it was not pleaded. I thus adjourned the trial for all nec essary amendments to be made. 

6       On 14 Marc h 2013 I gave leave to the plaintiff to amend the writ to reflec t his new name. I then adjourned the matter to 21 April 2013 to give direc tions regarding disc losure of doc uments. On 21 April 2013 I gave leave to the defendant to amend his defenc e to plead estoppel. It was then that Mr Cheng informed me that the defendant had rec ently disc overed that the plaintiff was involved in six ac c idents from 2006 to 2012, one in eac h year, exc ept 2009, whic h seemed to be the only ac c ident-free year for him. In the applic ation before AR Devi it was disc losed that the plaintiff had two other ac c idents after the one in question in this suit. Those ac c idents were made known bec ause the defendant was c hallenging c ausation in the plaintiff’s c laim for damages. It is unusual for a plaintiff to be involved in six ac c idents in seven years. Mr Cheng had, until 4 Marc h 2013, only known of three ac c idents involving the plaintiff, but in the c ourse of the further disc overy applic ation he learnt of three others prior to 2010. 

7       On 23 May 2013 the adjourned Registrar’s Appeal c onc erning the plaintiff’s applic ation for a sec ond interim payment was heard and dismissed. It was also made known to me at that time through submission of the defendant’s c ounsel (and not disputed) that the plaintiff was an undisc harged bankrupt. 

8       It may indeed be truly c oinc idental for the plaintiff to have suc h bad luc k, but the c irc umstanc es indic ate that a fuller inquiry might be nec essary. Thus I do not think that the c ourt should endorse the settlement until then. The defendant may not be blamed for wishing to settle bec ause it might not be financ ially sensible to litigate. However, there are serious questions to be answered whic h, perhaps the defendant has no means of investigating. I thus dec lined to approve the settlement and am direc ting the Registrar, Supreme Court to refer this matter to the AttorneyGeneral’s Chambers for investigation. It is not known for c ertain, how many other ac c idents the plaintiff had been involved in sinc e some might be settled out of c ourt. It is not known why the plaintiff c hanged his name and how many times he had done so. The plaintiff’s status as an undisc harged bankrupt might also be inquired into as it also appears that the plaintiff was driving a c ommerc ial vehic le in at least one of the ac c idents that he was involved in. Further, without making any assumptions but, for c ompleteness, it may be relevant to inquire into the details and c irc umstanc es of all the defendants involved in the various ac c idents with this plaintiff – whether they have any c onnec tions or previous dealings with the plaintiff; and whether they had been involved in other ac c idents. It is not unc ommon for plaintiffs to exaggerate their c laims for damages, but in the light of the plaintiff’s history, and the medic al report of his injury, his c laim might be exaggerated or his injuries unrelated to the ac c ident in question. The full medic al reports in all of the plaintiff’s ac c idents were not available in this suit and it would be relevant to examine them all sideby-side, and to inquire whether the examining doc tors were informed by the plaintiff that he had been in previous road ac c idents. 

9       It seems sensible that insurers should have a c ommon database so that repeat c laims c an be trac ked and trac ed. Insuranc e c ompanies may have to do more to guard themselves against unmeritorious or exaggerated c laims. First, front-to-rear ac c idents are not diffic ult to fake, and with minimal impac t, c laims for massive damages may arise. Not just for whiplash injury (not diffic ult to substantiate as many people have bulging disc s and c ervic al spondylosis even without any trauma) but also for medic al expenses and physiotherapy. There is also the risk of exaggerating the damage c laim to the vehic le. Sec ondly, the law generally holds the party whose vehic le was rear-ended blameless or almost blameless. Unmeritorious c laims are therefore diffic ult for lawyers to detec t, and that makes it diffic ult for the c ourts to spot suc h c laims. 

10     Pending ac tion from the Attorney General, this matter is adjourned _sine die_.
