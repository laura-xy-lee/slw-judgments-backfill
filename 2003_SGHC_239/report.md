_Contract_ – _Formation_ – _Whether binding contract entered into between parties._ 

1       Reuters Singapore Pte Ltd (“Reuters Singapore”) had, prior to 1993, a tec hnic al division within it whic h provided field support servic es to c ustomers subsc ribing to Reuters information servic es. These field servic es c omprised the installing, servic ing, reloc ating, rec overing and maintaining the hardware and software installed by Reuters Singapore at the offic es of its c ustomers. In 1993, Reuters Singapore dec ided to outsourc e the provision of suc h field servic es. As a result its field servic es division had to be c losed. Some employees from within that division grouped together and inc orporated a c ompany – Computer Interfac e Singapore Pte Ltd (“CIS”) – to provide those servic es from outside. From that time onwards CIS has been providing field servic es to Reuters Singapore under c onsec utive c ontrac ts of between 2 and 3 years duration. The last suc h c ontrac t was for a period of 2 years c ommenc ing 30 June 2000. One Bala Supramaniam (“Bala”) was the Managing Direc tor of CIS. 

2       In Dec ember 1999, as required under the terms of its c ontrac t, CIS gave notic e to Reuters Singapore of its willingness to negotiate the renewal of the c ontrac t but was informed by Reuters Singapore that it had rec eived a direc tive from its Head Offic e in London that in order to save c osts, tenders should be c alled for the provision of suc h servic es. Thereafter, Reuters Singapore invited five c ompanies – CIS, IBM, Siemens, Gentronic s and Compaq Computer Asia Pte Ltd (“Compaq”), the defendants in this ac tion – to bid for the provision of field servic es for a period of 3 years with effec t from 1 July 2000 and formal tender doc uments were sent to these c ompanies. The Direc tor of Compaq in c harge of this matter was Lawrenc e Mok (“Mok”). 

3       Reuters Singapore was anxious that its servic es to its c ustomers should not suffer any disruption by any c hange in the servic e provider and therefore requested the five c ompanies to explore possibilities of working together with CIS in the event their tender was ac c epted. Compaq took up this request. Mok had several disc ussions with Bala on the possibilities of c o-operation. Amongst the alternatives disc ussed were: (a) Compaq making the bid and, if suc c essful, subc ontrac ting to Reuters Singapore; (b) Compaq and CIS submitting a joint bid; and (c ) both Compaq and CIS submitting separate bids and whoever is suc c essful c onsider entering into a sub-c ontrac t with the other in order to c apitalise on their respec tive c apac ities in different areas of operation. These disc ussions did not result in any agreement and it was dec ided that Compaq and CIS would bid separately. 

4       After the tenders had been rec eived, Reuters Singapore c alled in CIS and Compaq and informed them that they were the two lowest tenderers and asked them to re-submit their bids as their quotes were still too high. Both CIS and Compaq c omplied with this request and submitted fresh bids. 

5       It turned out that Compaq submitted a bid lower than CIS. Reuters Singapore, however, was 


hesitant about awarding the tender to Compaq as Reuters Singapore had misgivings about the ability of Compaq to provide the field servic es as effic iently as CIS had been doing. Dennis Lim (“Dennis”), the Managing Direc tor of Reuters Singapore, c ommunic ated this misgiving to Mok and asked Compaq to do a presentation detailing the manner in whic h Compaq would c arry out the servic es. 

6       At the presentation made on 16 May 2000, one of the options (Option 2) suggested by Compaq was that Compaq would provide the servic es in c onjunc tion with CIS. Option 2 attrac ted the interest of Reuters Singapore and on 18 May 2000 Reuters Singapore issued a “Conditional Letter of Intent” stating that Compaq would be awarded the field servic es c ontrac t with effec t from 1 July 2000 provided Compaq met the following c onditions: 

 (a) Compaq will work with CIS as proposed under Option 2. 

 (b) Compaq will, within 5 working days (19 – 25 May 2000), finalise the Compaq/CIS partnership. 

 (c ) By 26 May 2000, Compaq would give Reuters Singapore a doc ument detailing the partnership arrangement with CIS with CIS signature on it. 

 (d) A 3-party (Compaq/CIS/Reuters Singapore) meeting was to be held not later than 29 May 2000. 

The Conditional Letter of Intent ended on the note that Reuters Singapore, in dec iding whether to award the c ontrac t to Compaq or otherwise, will assess the proposal as a whole. 

7       Compaq forwarded the Conditional Letter of Intent to CIS and intensive disc ussions ensued between Compaq and CIS as to how the two c ompanies c ould work together. On 26 May 2000 – the day stipulated in the Conditional Letter of Intent – Compaq and CIS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) and Compaq forwarded that MOU to Reuters Singapore. The MOU envisaged that CIS will be a sub-c ontrac tor and not a partner or agent of Compaq in the provision of the field servic es. Rec ital 4 of the MOU stated that “a formal servic es sub-c ontrac t will be entered into between CIS and Compaq within a reasonable period of time whic h shall not be more than 30 days from the date of signing of this MOU”. 

8       The 30-day stipulation in the Rec ital of the MOU for the c ontrac t between Compaq and CIS to be c onc luded was, no doubt, nec essitated by the fac t that Compaq would have to c ommenc e providing its servic es to Reuters Singapore by 1 July 2000: it would therefore be important to both Compaq and CIS have the sub-c ontrac t in plac e by then. 

9       The MOU (in an attac hment) c ontained, inter alia, the following c lauses: 

1\. A subc ontrac t agreement will be entered into with CIS for providing servic es of installation and maintenanc e. The Terms and c onditions will be _back to back_ depending on Reuter’s agreement with Compaq. Pric e to be given to CIS will be determined based on further negotiation between     Compaq and CIS. CIS will give Compaq a formal quote for the work to be done whic h shall not be more than the amount quoted by CIS to Reuters. 

 ... 

5\. The subc ontrac t _agreement will run for 3 years_ and is c anc elable at the option of Compaq if the servic es provided by CIS are not in line with generally ac c epted levels of servic e indic ated by 


 Reuters in the Contrac t or not as per the subc ontrac t agreement entered into with Compaq. Any notic e for c anc ellation will give detailed reasoning for c anc ellation and c anc ellation would be effec tive only after 60 days from the date of giving the notic e. [Emphasis added] 

It was c lear from the MOU and its attac hments that it was, from the beginning, envisaged that the sub-c ontrac t term would be for a term of 3 years and that its terms would be “bac k-to-bac k” with the terms of the main c ontrac t between Compaq and Reuters Singapore. It was also c lear that the parties were envisaged that this 3-year sub-c ontrac t was not to be terminated exc ept for c ause. 

10     As required in the Conditional Letter of Intent, a meeting was held on 29 May 2000 at the offic e of Reuters Singapore between Reuters Singapore, Compaq and CIS for Reuters Singapore to dec ide whether to award the c ontrac t to Compaq. Dennis told the c ourt that he noted from c ll 1 and 5 of the MOU (whic h are quoted above) that Compaq would have a bac k-to-bac k agreement with CIS for the provision of the field servic es for the duration of Compaq’s c ontrac t with Reuters Singapore and this satisfied him that Compaq would be able to provide the nec essary level of servic es that Reuters Singapore expec ted. He was therefore prepared to ac c ept the tender of Compaq. Bala, however, was not at the meeting and Dennis did not want to make a final dec ision until he was sure that Bala was satisfied with the arrangement. Dennis therefore re-sc heduled the meeting to enable Bala to attend. 

11     At the re-sc heduled meeting held in early June 2000, Dennis sought c onfirmation from Bala that CIS would perform the field servic es as Compaq’s sub-c ontrac tors on the terms c ontained in the MOU. Upon Bala giving this c onfirmation, Dennis informed Compaq that their tender was ac c epted. Upon suc h ac c eptanc e the terms c ontained in the tender submitted by Compaq would c onstitute the c ontrac t (the main c ontac t) between Compaq and CIS. The formal c ontrac t between the two was signed on 13 July 2000, about 2 weeks after CIS ac c epted the LOA. 

12     The MOU c alled for the sub-c ontrac t between Compaq and CIS to be entered into within 30 days of the MOU. On 30 June 2000 – the last day of the existing CIS field servic es c ontrac t with Reuters Singapore – Compaq issued to CIS a doc ument headed “Letter of Award” for ac c eptanc e by CIS. Attac hed to the Letter of Award (“LOA”) were various sc hedules, taken mainly from the tender doc uments detailing, inter alia, the servic es to be rendered, the c harges payable and the terms of the engagement of CIS. The LOA reflec ted the terms that had been agreed upon and so Bala signed the ac c eptanc e of the LOA by CIS at the spac e provided. 

13     Confident that the grant of the LOA was suffic ient evidenc e that the main terms of the sub-c ontrac t had been agreed, CIS, from 1 July 2000 onwards, c ontinued to provide the field servic es to the c ustomers of Reuters Singapore on behalf of Compaq. It is interesting to note that even after Compaq bec ame the servic e provider of Reuters Singapore, Reuters Singapore c ontinued to send its work orders for field servic es work – as it had for the past several years – to CIS and CIS c arried out the work requested. As CIS was c arrying out these servic es on behalf of Compaq, CIS invoic ed Compaq for the servic es in ac c ordanc e with the payment terms set out in the LOA. This state of affairs c ontinued for about 18 months. 

14     It would appear that at about the time that Compaq and CIS were having the disc ussions referred to above, negotiations were going on in London between the head offic es of Compaq and Reuters – negotiations in whic h Compaq in Singapore and Reuters in Singapore played no role – with a view to entering into a framework agreement whose provisions would, as far as possible, apply to any servic e c ontrac t that any Compaq c ompany may sec ure with any Reuters c ompany anywhere in the world. These negotiations were suc c essfully c onc luded and a Framework Agreement was signed in London on 1 July 2000 – one month after Compaq’s tender for the Reuters Singapore c ontrac t had 


been ac c epted by Compaq. 

15     The London negotiations did not feature in the disc ussions held between Compaq, CIS and Reuters Singapore in c onnec tion with the Reuters Singapore tender exerc ise. It was not alleged, on behalf of Compaq, that CIS had been put on notic e about the impending Framework Agreement and the implic ations, if any, that that Agreement, if entered into, may have on any agreement that Compaq may enter into with CIS. 

16     The work relationship between CIS and Compaq when CIS started providing field servic es to Reuters Singapore on behalf of Compaq was fairly smooth. Compaq duly paid all the invoic es from CIS in ac c ordanc e with the rates c ontained in the sc hedule to the LOA and even made an advanc e payment of $210,000 to CIS towards those invoic es. Problems only began to surfac e many months on. 

17     The c ontents of the LOA c onstitute a pivotal part of CIS c laim and Compaq’s defenc e. It will therefore be useful to set out the LOA in full: 

 Dear Mr Supramaniam 

 LETTER OF AWARD (“LOA”) 

 1 It is our pleasure to hereby c onfirm that, subject to final terms and conditions being agreed between Compaq Computer Asia Pte Ltd (“COMPAQ”) and Computer Interfac e Singapore Pte Ltd (“CIS”), we have selected CIS to supply the installation, maintenance and related services for the Reuters Field Outsourc ing projec t in Singapore. 

 2 The attached schedules will form part of the Agreement. By accepting this LOA, CIS agrees to commence the project on the terms stated on the schedules. Both parties agree that they will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Agreement is negotiated and signed on or before Friday 14th July 2000. If the Agreement has not been entered into by 17th July 2000, a new target date for the signing of the Agreement will then be mutually agreed between the parties. 

 3 The Agreement shall take effect on 1st July 2000 and subject to any ability to terminate it under the Agreement shall expire 3 years after such date. 

 4 Both parties also agree that the operations will be reviewed six months from 1 July 2000 for better c ontrol in ec onomic of sc ale and improvement in produc tivity, whic h c ost c ould be saved and passed on to Compaq. 

 5 We would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your staff for the keen support and c ooperation that you have extended to us during the negotiations. We look forward to the establishment of a mutually benefic ial relationship. 

 Yours faithfully Ac c epted by

The sc hedules to the LOA were essentially extrac ts from the tender doc uments. This was only to be expec ted as, upon ac c eptanc e of its tender by Reuters Singapore, the terms of the tender doc uments submitted by Compaq bec ame the c ontrac t between Compaq and Reuters Singapore (the main c ontrac t) and the sub-c ontrac t with CIS, at least as per the understanding c ontained in the MOU, was to be “bac k-to-bac k” with the main c ontrac t. The pric es to be paid to CIS for its servic es and whic h were inc orporated in the sc hedule to the LOA were the pric es that CIS had quoted in its revised bid to Reuters Singapore. 

18     The LOA in c l 1 made referenc e to “final terms” being agreed and c l 2 provided that the parties would take all reasonable steps to ensure that the agreement c ontaining the final terms would be signed by 14 July 2000. The c lause also provided that if the agreement was not signed by 17 July 2000 a new target date for the signing would be mutually agreed. The task of drafting that agreement was undertaken by Compaq: Compaq, being a large organisation with a legal division to attend to suc h matters. However, Compaq ignored those time lines and left the drafting of that doc ument in abeyanc e. 

19     To c o-ordinate and monitor the servic es provided to Reuters Singapore by Compaq, frequent tripartite management meetings were held between Reuters Singapore, Compaq and CIS. The minutes of suc h a meeting held on 1 August 2000 show that Bala requested Compaq for the draft agreement and it was rec orded that the draft would be provided by 11 August 2000. The minutes of a meeting held on 10 August 2000 reflec t that Bala again made the same request and it was represented that the draft would be ready by 18 August 2000. 

20     A draft agreement was eventually e-mailed to Bala by Janet Heng (“Janet”), the Consumer Servic e Ac c ounts Manager of Compaq, in late August/early September 2000. It was a lengthy doc ument based on Compaq's standard re-seller agreement: a doc ument whic h Bala c onsidered was totally inappropriate to serve as a basis for a servic e and maintenanc e c ontrac t. Bala made extensive deletions, variations and suggestions to try and make the draft more appropriate for the purpose in hand and e-mailed it bac k to Janet with his c omments. Bala also sent to Janet the previous Reuters Singapore/CIS field servic es c ontrac t as a more appropriate model to follow. The first draft sent by Janet to Bala envisaged a 3-year agreement between Compaq and CIS. 

21     There was no response for a long time to Bala’s e-mail. The minutes of the Management Meeting on 27 Oc tober 2000 show that Bala again raised the matter of the draft. The response, as stated in the minutes, was: “Waiting for JH [Janet] to redraft”. The same formula “Waiting for JH to redraft” appear in the minutes of the meetings held on 14 November 2000 and 7 Dec ember 2000. In the minutes of 7 Dec ember 2000 it was noted: “The c ontrac t should be available on the week of Dec 11”. 

22     Sometime after 11 Dec ember 2000, Janet e-mailed Bala a draft c ontaining various modific ations from the previous draft. Bala had some disc ussions with Janet on the draft but, on 13 


February 2001, Janet informed him that with immediate effec t one Choo Choon Tec k (“Choo”) would deal with Bala on the draft. Bala never heard from Choo. 

23     I noted that Mok who – in order to c omply with Reuters Singapore requirements in the Letter of Intent issued to Compaq – had been very ac tive in getting the c o-operation of CIS, took a bac kseat after CIS signed the LOA. The drafting of the agreement (whic h was to inc lude the final terms that were agreed) was left to junior offic ers in Compaq and it was obvious from the evidenc e of Janet, Choo and Mok, that the signing of the sub-c ontrac t was not a matter of any urgenc y to Compaq. 

24     This lac k of enthusiasm on the part of Compaq to draft the agreement c ould be an indic ation that Compaq was satisfied that there was already a binding c ontrac t between it and CIS and therefore saw no urgent need to sign a formal agreement. It c ould also be an indic ation that it suited Compaq – in the event Compaq dec ided to reduc e the volume of work to be performed by CIS or even to get rid of CIS altogether – not to entrenc h CIS position with a further signed c ontrac t. 

25     On 16 January 2001, whilst the disc ussions with Janet on her revised draft were going on, Compaq sent a somewhat c urt e-mail to Bala stating: 

 ... this is to inform you that we will be doing some of the installation as and when nec essary. This will c over all the produc t range of Reuters. 

This e-mail was a prec ursor to other steps taken by Compaq to whittle down CIS involvement in the Reuters Singapore projec t. Bala told the c ourt that he was upset by this e-mail. He was upset bec ause Compaq, without any prior disc ussion, was going to take over some of the work that had been sub-c ontrac ted to CIS. Bala c onsidered this direc tive to be c ontrary to the agreement that all field servic es would, for the duration of the 3 years, be performed by CIS. 

26     Bala responded immediately to Compaq. In his e-mail to Compaq, Bala stated: 

 this is not the way to c onduc t business, I was told by lawrenc e that all reuters work will be given to us until further notic e if there is c hange of plan please inform us ac c ordingly so that we c an c ut our manpower requirement. it is no use having staff sitting here doing nothing if you are going to takeover the reuter work. pls get your ac t togather (sic ) and let me know exac tly what you want to do so that we c an plan our resourc es ac c ordingly. 

I noted that Bala in that e-mail had not, in terms, taken the position that this reduc tion of businesses of CIS was a breac h of Compaq’s sub-c ontrac t with CIS. Bala’s explanation for this was that CIS, as a small c ompany dependent almost entirely on the Reuters business for its survival, was in no position to c onfront Compaq and therefore had to be as ac c ommodating as possible. 

27     As noted earlier, Reuters Singapore had, from 1 July 2000, been sending all their work orders direc t to CIS. Soon after the exc hange of the above e-mails, Compaq made arrangements with Reuters Singapore for all work orders to be sent in the first plac e to Compaq. Bala told the c ourt that by instituting this c hange Compaq was able to gradually take away work that would otherwise have been performed by CIS. 

28     From about August 2001, Compaq began to press CIS to reduc e the pric es at whic h CIS was rendering its field servic es. Not getting the desired reduc tion, Venkat Eswaran, the Financ e and Operations Manager of Compaq, on 25 Oc tober 2001, wrote to CIS asking CIS to review its installation pric es and stating that Compaq was: “expec ting a downward adjustment in the installation pric es”. 


29     CIS response to Compaq, by letter dated 26 November 2001, was as follows: 

 In our numerous past meetings and disc ussions, we have at length, been very open and detailed with the c omputation of our installation c osts to your c olleagues. This fac t stems well even before Compaq and us agreed to c ollaborate in providing a bac k-to-bac k outsourc ing agreement to Reuters. The c ost that you have today were further adjusted and importantly, ac c epted by your c olleagues more then (sic ) eighteen months ago. 

 Thus far, the c all for us to reduc e our installation pric es to you c omes as a surprise, c onsidering what was told to us at that time. Additionally, the past year also, saw some aspec ts of the bac k-to-bac k agreement for Reuters installations ignored, as Compaq have taken anything from 20% to more than 50% of the work that were available. 

 It is therefore with great diffic ulty that we have to revert to you that we are unable to ac c ede to your requirement at this point in time. We are however, more than ready, as offered in previous meetings with your c olleagues, to help you to renegotiate with Reuters on some of the installation pric es, to bring it to some degree of parity. Thank you and best regards. 

There was no direc t response from Compaq to this letter. CIS c ontinued to invoic e Compaq on the basis of the rates originally agreed to and the invoic es were paid by Compaq. 

30     By letter dated 18 Dec ember 2001 Compaq informed CIS that Compaq had, at the request of Reuters Singapore, agreed to make c ertain c hanges to the servic es that Compaq was providing to Reuters Singapore. The letter went on to say: 

 For the past year and a half, you have been providing servic es to Reuters on our behalf. This was done notwithstanding the fac t that CIS and Compaq have not signed any agreement for these servic es although we rec ognize that a draft agreement was disc ussed. However, given the request from Reuters and our c ontinued working relationship with CIS, we would like to disc uss with yourselves the following c hanges to the operational model. In the new model, Compaq will: 

 1. Use existing CIS resourc es as appropriate and direc tly manage these resourc es, 2. Set up a field offic e and will c onsider sub-leasing existing fac ilities from CIS as appropriate, and 3. Look to revising the financ ial and c ommerc ial terms with CIS to reflec t the new requirement. 

 Reuters have given us a deadline to fully implement the new model. As time is of the essenc e we would like to disc uss and c onc lude with you by 24th Dec ember 2001 the role that CIS c an partic ipate in the new model, the resourc es and fac ilities that c an be offered to Compaq and the financ ial and c ommerc ial terms of the arrangement. 

The proposed alterations to the servic e model proposed by Compaq in their letter of 18 Dec ember 2001 were extensive and CIS felt that the time dead-line of 24 Dec ember 2001 was unrealistic ally short. 

31     On 24 Dec ember 2001, CIS wrote to Compaq asking for more time to c onsider the proposal. In this letter CIS stated: 

 Our understanding from our past interac tion with COMPAQ personnel (Ramaraj, Lawrenc e, Srikant etc .) has been that our c ontrac t with you will stay status quo for three years based on a “bac kto-bac k” outsourc ed agreement reac hed with REUTERS SINGAPORE. While no c ontrac t has been signed, given that COMPAQ did not replac e the person that left, who was responsible for finalizing the terms and c onditions, we have c ontinued to provide support based on trust and sinc erity. It 


 is apparent and unfortunate that this has not be enough to see through the existing agreement, albeit, the signed MOU issued by COMPAQ. 

 We hope you c ould set a more realistic time-line so that all parties c onc erned c an agree a more ac c urate set of c osting/financ ials without resorting to any drop in servic e levels. 

 Thank you for you understanding and support and “Merry Christmas”. 

Compaq’s response to this letter – given that same evening by one Job Chan – was c urt: Compaq was prepared to extend the time only to 9am on 26 Dec ember 2001. The letter explic itly stated that there would be no further extensions of time and that Compaq will not ac c ept any quotation beyond 9am on 26 Dec ember 2001. 

32     On 26 Dec ember 2001, Bala wrote to Mok explaining why CIS c ould not ac c ept the new servic e model. He said: 

 This letter is in response to Mr Job Chan’s email of 24 Dec ember 2001 at 6.36 p.m. 

 We refer to your letter dated 30 June 2000 and wish to reiterate that we have already forwarded the draft agreement with proposed amendments on our part and there was no response from your side. Henc e, the agreement was not signed. 

 Despite this, for the last one and a half years both parties have been providing Reuters with the nec essary servic es jointly. It was a c lear understanding of the parties that there was to be mutual provision of servic es jointly and it was also our understanding that Reuters Singapore had imposed the c ondition that although Compaq has a direc t c ontrac t with them, Compaq has to work jointly with us to provide these servic es. 

 However, on the 18 Dec ember 2001, we were surprised and astonished to rec eive a letter from Mr Lawrenc e Mok whic h in a nutshell c learly stipulates that the joint venture agreement to provide servic es to Reuters is no longer to c ontinue to be valid, and that you are to provide direc t management and operational c ontrol and c omplete c ontac t with Reuters. This will reduc e our servic e to that of a mere subc ontrac tor. You are aware that we will not be able to work on this basis as it will lead to substantial financ ial losses for us and not to mention that we will not have direc t management, operation and c ontrol of the servic es provided to Reuters. In substanc e, no partnership or joint c o-operation exists between Compaq and Computer Interfac e based on this new delivery model. 

 Finally, if we c annot sit and negotiate an agreement whic h is mutually and c ommerc ially benefic ial to both of us, as was the arrangement previously mentioned in the MOU, i.e. based on joint c ooperation and partnership, we are not in a position to c ontinue on the new model. By your new model as per your letter dated 18/12/01, you are seeking unilaterally imposed terms and c onditions, whic h are not c ommerc ial viable to us. If you insist on the terms in your letter dated 18/12/01, we have no alternative but to seek legal redress. 

Compaq’s response to this letter was to terminate, with immediate effec t, its “arrangement” with CIS. 

33     The letter of termination was dated 28 Dec ember 2001 and it was signed by Mok. It read: 

 We refer to our letter dated 18 Dec ember 2001 and our subsequent meetings and telephone c onversations. We note that in you letter of 26 Dec ember 2001 you do not agree to the new 


 servic e delivery model required by Reuters. We previously advised that time is of the essenc e and the need to finalize the new arrangements with Computer Interfac e Singapore Pte Ltd (“CIS”) by 24 Dec ember 2001 and in subsequent c ommunic ations with you this was moved to 26 Dec ember 2001. This time has now passed. 

 We regret to inform you that the arrangement between CIS and Compaq is terminated with immediate effect and we will move to implement the new model for Reuters without CIS’ partic ipation. 

 We are still open to your partic ipation in a suitable manner, based on the new servic e delivery model required by Reuters, should you revert to us by 5 January 2002. [Emphasis added] 

Bala testified that he found it “odd” that Compaq, having refused to ac c ept any quotation from CIS after 9am on 26 Dec ember 2001, should now invite CIS to disc uss further. I do not see that invitation as “odd”. What Compaq was doing by this letter was terminating the (existing) “arrangement” between Compaq and CIS and seeking a fresh agreement with CIS. 

34     On rec eiving the letter of termination, Bala got in touc h with Les Clemenson (“Clemenson”) who had taken over from Dennis as the Managing Direc tor of Reuters Singapore. Bala learnt from Clemenson that while it was true that Reuters Singapore was seeking to re-negotiate its c ontrac t with Compaq, Reuters Singapore had not required Compaq to re-negotiate its arrangements with CIS. Soon after this c onversation with Clemenson, CIS instruc ted its solic itors, Harpal Mahtani Partnership (“HMP”), to respond to Compaq’s letter of termination of 28 Dec ember 2001. 

35     HMP wrote to Compaq on 2 January 2002 and in that letter stated: 

 Our c lients’ instruc tions are as follows: 

1\. our c lient have made their position very c lear to you in their letter of 26 Dec ember 2001, i.e. that it would not be c ommerc ially liable (sic ) for them to c ontinue in joint c orporation with you on the new servic e delivery model, even if the same is imposed by Reuters; 

2\. that the new servic e delivery model is not being imposed by Reuters; 

3\. if you still insist on the new servic e delivery model whic h you are seeking to impose unilateral (sic ) on our c lients and whic h is not agreeable to them, your notic e to terminate our c lients’ c ontrac t with immediate effec t after 1½ years is not valid. Our c lients have not breac hed the agreement and further they have engaged professional and other staff on a three (3) years c ontrac t pursuant to the letter of award dated 30 June 2000; and 

4\. that our c lients are entitled to full c ompensation of 1½ years as the agreement of joint c orporation was for a period of three (3) years. 

 Our c lients further instruc ts us to reiterate that they are prepared to c ontinue to provide servic es in joint c orporation with you, but not on the new servic e delivery model. 

It is c lear from the last paragraph of this letter that CIS was, even at this stage, keen to c ontinue providing field servic es to Reuters Singapore but was not prepared to ac c ept the variations now being proposed by Compaq. 

36     Ac c ording to Bala, Compaq had, by the time it issued the letter of termination, rec ruited 


suffic ient staff strength to provide the requisite servic es to Reuters Singapore without the assistanc e of CIS. Nevertheless, Compaq c ontinued to pass some work orders on to CIS. CIS c ould have refused to handle these work orders but the management of CIS – who, ac c ording to Bala, still had strong loyalty to Reuters Singapore – did not want to c ause diffic ulties to Reuters and so c ontinued to c arry out the work orders in spite of the letter of termination. 

37     On 18 January 2002, Clemenson, followed up on his disc ussions with Bala and wrote to CIS as follows: 

 Following on from our telephone disc ussion last week I have as I promised reviewed the situation from the Reuters perspec tive whic h inc luded me meeting with Compaq’s senior management yesterday. 

 Reuters has a c ontrac t with Compaq for the provision of servic es in Singapore and how Compaq deliver their c ontrac tual obligations is outside of Reuters c ontrol. When we signed with them, we made it c lear that we believed Reuters interest would be best served by them having a bac k to bac k arrangement with yourself. 

 After 18 months of the c ontrac t period we, for our own business reasons elec ted to enter fresh negotiations with Compaq. This forms part of a global strategic review of field servic es outsourc ing arrangements in the AP region. We dec ided to do this bec ause of market c onditions and also bec ause our global sourc ing programme required that we rec onsider some of the ways we have been doing this loc ally to bring them in line with our global best prac tic es. 

 Reuters has made no suggestions to Compaq to renegotiate the arrangement with CIS nor for your c ompany to be removed as their subc ontrac tor. However in order to meet the new requirements we plac ed on them it would seem from what I have been told by them and yourself that Compaq wished to enter into fresh negotiations with you. 

 It is not really for Reuters to c omment on the proc esses or disc ussions that have taken plac e between you. When we spoke you told me that you thought Compaq were being unreasonable and their ac tions would lead to CIS having major financ ial diffic ulties. 

 My c onc ern is to ensure that Reuters c ustomers rec eive the servic e level we wish to provide them. To this end it remains in our interest to ensure there is c ontinuity of servic e provision as the Compaq and CIS relationship resolves itself. 

 Compaq have given me their assuranc e that they are negotiating with you in good faith and that the offer they have put before you will in their opinion ensure c ontinuity of servic e to us and is also a fair c ommerc ial arrangement. I am not party to the inner details and have no wish to be, they do however tell me they: 

 a) offered to retain the servic es through CIS of 20 of the c urrent 24 engineering staff who work on the Reuters ac c ount 

 b) offered to retain the servic es through CIS of 3 help desk staff 

 c ) offered to purc hase and retain further assets and staff (vehic les and drivers) 

 d) have guaranteed to pay for the lease of the whole CIS offic e through until mid 2003 (ie the end of the original three year period) and make spac e available to CIS within this for your 


 non Reuters business. 

 They implied to me that they are awaiting your answer on this offer. I trust this information is c orrec t, albeit and to repeat what I said before, the finer detail is unknown to me. 

 Given this understanding and Compaq’s assuranc e that they are negotiating with you in good faith I am not sure what else I c an do to assist – if you c an think of something I am more than happy to c onsider it. 

Compaq and CIS, enc ouraged by Reuters Singapore, held disc ussions to try to resolve the diffic ulties between them. These disc ussions, however, c ame to naught. 

38     Bala, in a letter to Mok dated 30 January 2002, set out the reasons why CIS c ould not ac c ept Compaq’s proposal and c onc luded the letter by stating: 

 In view of the above, unless we are able to revert to the previous bac k to bac k arrangement or you have other proposals whic h c an add value and provide financ ial benefits to CIS, we c annot see how we c an c ontinue with our business relationship for the future. 

On 1 February 2002, Mok responded to say that in the c irc umstanc es Compaq will make the nec essary arrangements to c ontinue providing the servic es to Reuters Singapore on its own. 

39     The disc ussions with Compaq having failed, CIS c ommenc ed this suit against Compaq wherein CIS c laimed that there was a sub-c ontrac t between Compaq and CIS for the provision of field servic es to Reuters Singapore and c laimed damages from Compaq for the wrongful termination of that sub-c ontrac t. It was CIS c ase that the said sub-c ontrac t was partly in writing, partly by c onduc t and partly oral and that when CIS c ommenc ed work on 1 July 2000 that sub-c ontrac t was in effec t and Compaq was obliged by its terms to allow CIS to provide field servic es to Reuters Singapore for a period of 3 years on a bac k-to-bac k basis with the c ontrac t that Compaq had with Reuters Singapore at that time. 

40     At about the time the writ was issued CIS terminated the servic es of 37 members of its staff. This was bec ause Reuters Singapore had always been the princ ipal c lient of CIS and with the termination of its sub-c ontrac t with Compaq, these staff members had no work to do. CIS c laim for damages for breac h inc luded the salary and retrenc hment benefits paid to these staff members. It was, however, agreed that the hearing would be c onfined to liability and that the question of damages will be c onsidered separately if CIS is suc c essful in this suit. 

41     The doc uments that CIS was relying on to support the alleged sub-c ontrac t were the MOU; the LOA; the drafts exc hanged between Bala and Janet; and the letter from Compaq to CIS dated 18 Dec ember 2001. Save for the drafts, the c ontents of these doc uments have been set out above. The only aspec t of the drafts exc hanged between Bala and Janet that CIS was relying on was the fac t that the drafts envisaged a 3-year c ontrac t. The c onduc t relied on was the fac t that CIS had provided the requisite field servic es to Reuters Singapore from 1 July 2000 and Compaq had paid for those servic es as agreed. It was argued on behalf of CIS that this c onduc t was evidenc e of the fac t that there was a binding agreement between Compaq and CIS for CIS to perform the field servic es to Reuters Singapore on behalf of Compaq on terms set out in the LOA. 

42     Compaq denied having entered into any sub-c ontrac t at all with CIS. Compaq argued that the words “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed” in the LOA meant that there c ould be no c ontrac t between Compaq and CIS until the agreement referred to in c l 2 of the LOA was signed. 


It was Compaq’s c ase that as that agreement had not been signed, the LOA amounted to no more than a mere “arrangement” whereby CIS, if requested by Compaq, would perform the servic es requested by Compaq at the fees set out in the Sc hedule thereto. It was submitted by Mr Philip Tay (“Mr Tay”), c ounsel for Compaq, that suc h an arrangement had no binding effec t exc ept when CIS in fac t performed any servic e requested by Compaq in whic h event Compaq would be legally bound to pay for that servic e in ac c ordanc e with the fees set out in the Sc hedule. Compaq, he submitted, was ac ting entirely within its rights when it terminated this “arrangement” on 28 Dec ember 2001. 

43     Mr Tay also submitted that the c onduc t of CIS – partic ularly in pressing for the draft and its somewhat mild reac tion when informed about the proposed reduc tion of work orders – indic ated that CIS also ac c epted that it had no binding c ontrac t with Compaq. Mr Tay submitted that none of the doc uments relied on by CIS c onstituted a c ontrac t. The draft exc hanged between Bala and Janet, he submitted, was no more than a draft; the LOA was “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed” and was therefore not a c ontrac t; and the MOU, as the MOU itself provided, was “not a binding or definitive agreement and c reates no legal or binding obligation on either party”. 

44     The fac t that CIS had pressed Compaq to produc e the draft agreement did not, in my view, nec essarily mean that there was at that stage no binding c ontrac t between the parties. The LOA had envisaged that a formal agreement would be signed and all that Bala was doing was pressing for that to happen. Neither did the fac t that CIS tried to ac c ommodate and not c onfront Compaq, when Compaq reduc ed the volume of work orders to be attended to by CIS, nec essarily mean (unless waiver or estoppel was pleaded and established) that there was no enforc eable c ontrac tual obligation between them. These are, however, relevant fac tors to take into ac c ount when c onsidering the c onduc t of the parties. In that c onsideration, other relevant fac tors – suc h as the fac t that for a c onsiderable period after the award of the LOA, CIS had, on behalf of Compaq, provided all the field servic es required by Reuters Singapore – have to be taken into ac c ount. 

45     The most c ritic al of the doc umentary evidenc e produc ed in this c ase was the LOA of 30 June 

2000\. The fac t that Compaq gave this letter the heading “Letter of Award” was signific ant. Suc h a heading gives the impression that the negotiations between the parties had been suc c essfully c onc luded and Reuters Singapore was “awarding” the work to CIS. That impression is – if one ignores the words “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed” – reinforc ed by c l 1 of the LOA. In that c lause, Compaq “c onfirmed” that it had “selec ted” CIS to supply the installation, maintenanc e and related servic es for the Reuters Field Outsourc ing projec t in Singapore. That c lause – drafted by Compaq – does not impose any limitation or other qualific ation on the installation, maintenanc e and related servic es that CIS was to provide. In the absenc e of any words of limitation, the effec t of that c lause, as a matter of c onstruc tion, would be that “all” suc h works would be c arried out by CIS: a c onstruc tion c onsistent with Compaq sub-c ontrac ting the works “bac k-to-bac k” to CIS as envisaged in the MOU. 

46     Ignoring for the time being the effec t of the words “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed”, the language used in the LOA, namely: 

 the desc ription of the letter of 30 June 2000 as a “Letter of Award”; the c onfirmation in c l 1 thereof that Compaq had selected CIS to provide the requisite servic es; the statement in c l 2 that CIS by ac c epting the LOA agrees to c ommenc e work on the terms stated in the Sc hedules to the LOA; the emphatic statement in c l 3 that “the Agreement shall take effec t on 1st July 2000”; the expression of thanks to CIS in c l 5 for their c o-operation during the negotiations; 

all indic ate that the negotiations between Compaq and CIS had, by 30 June 2000, been suc c essfully c onc luded and that, upon CIS signing its ac c eptanc e in the spac e provided in the LOA, the agreement 


was in plac e. 

47     The fac t that after ac c epting the LOA, CIS rendered the requisite servic es for a period of 18 months was also a strong indic ator that by 1 July 2000 the terms of the sub-c ontrac t between Compaq and CIS had been agreed. The fac t that the LOA required the “award” to be “ac c epted” by CIS and that prior to c ommenc ing work on 1 July 2000 CIS had ac c epted that award is also signific ant. This is c onduc t indic ative of a desire to enter immediately into a binding arrangement. 

48     Nowhere in the LOA did Compaq say – as is their c laim now – that until a formal agreement was signed CIS was to provide “suc h servic es as may from time to time be requested by Compaq”. This does not appear in the MOU either. If that was the arrangement that Compaq wished to have with CIS for the provision of field servic es to Reuters Singapore from 1 July 2000, then Compaq – unless it wanted to mislead CIS – should (and indeed would) have made that c lear in the LOA. I say this bec ause providing “suc h servic es as may from time to time be requested by Compaq” is a far c ry from the “bac k-to-bac k” arrangement envisaged in the MOU and the tenor of the disc ussions held after that. 

49     I have no doubt – and I ac c ept Bala’s evidenc e in this regard – that had the MOU stated that CIS would only provide suc h servic es as Compaq may “from time to time” request, CIS would not have agreed to the MOU. Similarly, I ac c ept Bala’s evidenc e that if the LOA had stated that CIS, until a formal agreement is signed, would provide suc h servic es to Reuters Singapore as Compaq may “from time to time” request, CIS would not have ac c epted the LOA and would not have provided the servic es it did to Reuters Singapore from 1 July 2000. 

50     The question that has to be c onsidered is whether the words “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed” in c l 1 of the LOA derogates from the award by Compaq to CIS of the subc ontrac t. Numerous c ases were c ited in support of the proposition that when a doc ument states that it is “subjec t to c ontrac t” the c ourts, unless there is c ogent evidenc e of a c ontrary intention, c onstrue those words so as to postpone the inc idenc e of liability until a formal doc ument has been drafted and signed. Those c ases, however, are not of any partic ular relevanc e here sinc e the words used here were not the words “subjec t to c ontrac t” but the words “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed”. I will also not deal with the c ases where different formulae were used as the words involved and the fac tual matrix of those c ases were so different from the present c ase that those c ases c annot provide muc h assistanc e. 

51     The approac h taken when dealing with formulae other than the formula “subjec t to c ontrac t” is summarised in Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contrac t (Sec ond Singapore and Malaysian Edition 1998) at 100 as follows: 

 Upon the partic ular phrase “subjec t to c ontrac t” the pressure of litigation has stamped a prec ise signific anc e. In other c ases it is often diffic ult to dec ide if the language used justifies the inferenc e of a c omplete and final agreement. The task of the c ourts is to extrac t the intention of the parties both from the terms of their c orrespondenc e and from the c irc umstanc es whic h surround and follow it, and the question of interpretation may thus be stated. Is the preparation of a further document a condition precedent to the creation of a contract or is it an incident in the performance of an already binding obligation? As in all questions of c onstruc tion, the c omparison of dec ided c ases is apt to c onfuse rather than to illuminate. It would appear, however, that, whenever there is evidenc e that the parties have ac ted upon the faith of a written doc ument, the c ourts will prefer to assume that the doc ument embodies a definite intention to be bound and will strive to implement its terms. [Emphasis added] 


Mr Harpal Singh, who appeared for CIS, submitted that the answer to the question posed in the above passage – Is the preparation of a further doc ument a c ondition prec edent to the c reation of a c ontrac t or is it an inc ident in the performanc e of an already binding obligation? – would determine whether in this c ase a c ontrac t was or was not in existenc e. He submitted that in this c ase the essential terms of the c ontrac t had not only been agreed but had been implemented and that the signing of a formal agreement was therefore no more than an inc ident in the performanc e of an already binding obligation. 

52     On the evidenc e I heard, I was satisfied that as of the date of the LOA all material terms and c onditions nec essary for CIS to c ommenc e providing the installation, maintenanc e and related servic es to Reuters Singapore had been agreed upon in the LOA and CIS had, for a c onsiderable period of time thereafter, been providing the servic es on the terms agreed. The use of the word “final”, in the phrase “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed”, also suggests that at the date of the LOA the terms and c onditions had been agreed upon but as there were some final terms that the parties may agree upon, those terms (if agreed) would be inc luded in the formal agreement to be signed. 

53     The general tenor of the LOA (disc ussed in paras 45 and 46 above); the fac t that Compaq, in spite of the deadline of 14 July 2000 it set in the LOA, saw no urgenc y to draft the agreement in question; and the fac t that CIS provided the required servic es for a period of 18 months, all indic ate that the signing of a formal agreement was not in the nature of a c ondition prec edent to the c reation of a c ontrac t but merely an inc ident in the performanc e of an already existing c ontrac t. In other words, when CIS ac c epted the LOA, an agreement c ame into being whic h agreement – with the addition of suc h final terms and c onditions as may be agreed – was to be inc orporated into a formal agreement. I will add that even if the words “subjec t to final terms and c onditions being agreed” c ould be c onsidered as being similar in meaning to the words “subjec t to c ontrac t”, there was in this c ase c ogent evidenc e that the parties intended the LOA to have immediate c ontrac tual effec t. 

54     The agreement that c ame into being as a result of the ac c eptanc e by CIS of the LOA was that CIS would, for a period of 3 years with effec t from 1 July 2000, provide the installation, maintenanc e and related servic es for the Reuters Field Outsourc ing projec t in Singapore on the terms set out in the Sc hedules to the LOA. By withholding some of those servic es from CIS and by terminating this agreement without c ause before the 3-year period had run, Compaq was, in my view, in breac h of its c ontrac tual obligations to CIS. 

55     CIS, in its Statement of Claim, sought c ompensation for the loss and damage it suffered when Compaq wrongfully terminated its servic es. The parties had, however, requested at the c ommenc ement of the hearing that the assessment of that c ompensation should be dealt with separately and this request had been granted. I therefore give judgment (with c osts) for CIS in respec t of the wrongful termination of its servic es and order that the assessment of the damage arising from the said termination form the subjec t matter of a separate hearing to be c onduc ted by the Registrar. 

_Plaintiffs’ claim allowed._
