**Introduction** 

1       This c ase c onc erns the validity of a will made by Haji Ibrahim bin Abdul Samad (“the testator”), a Malay Muslim from Singapore. He passed away on 14 September 1997, having made his last will and testament on 9 Dec ember 1996, leaving behind a wife, three sons and seven daughters. The first and sec ond plaintiffs are two of the c hildren of the testator. The defendant is another son who is the exec utor of the testator’s estate. The plaintiffs are c hallenging parts of the will. 

2       The general issue in this ac tion is whether c ertain parts of the dec larations and bequests c ontained in the will ac c ord with the princ iples of Muslim law applic able to Muslims of the Shafii sc hool of law to whic h the testator and his heirs belong. 

3       A spec ific issue that falls for determination c onc erns an aspec t c alled “ _nuzriah_ ”. The term “ _nuzriah_ ” does not appear or feature in any of the treatises, writings or books published by or attributed to any Muslim sc holars or jurists. However, the c ourt was informed by the expert witness who appeared for the defendant that the word “ _nuzriah_ ” is derived from the word “ _nazar_ ”, that it is a minor _nazar_ and that both terms c onnote the same c onc ept. The term _nazar_ means “vow or a solemn pledge” and is defined in s 2 of the Administration of Muslim Law Ac t (Cap 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“AMLA”) as an expressed vow to do any ac t or to dedic ate property for any purpose allowed by Muslim law. 

4       Another issue relates to the c orrec tness or otherwise of the division of the property of the estate of the testator by the Legal or Fatwa Committee of the Singapore Islamic Counc il (Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura) (“Muis”). 


**Sources of Muslim law** 

5       Briefly stated, there are four sourc es of Muslim law. In so far as the Sunni Muslims are c onc erned, they are: The Quran (the Holy Book), _Hadis_ or _Hadith_ (the traditions of the Prophet, _viz_ the oral prec epts delivered from time to time by the prophet and referenc es to the daily mode of his life as handed down to posterity by his immediate followers), _Ijmaa_ (c onsensus amongst highly qualified legal sc holars), and _Qiyas_ (reasoning by analogy or analogic al deduc tion). 

**Muslim law of inheritance – a brief perspective** 

6       Muslim law and rules for dealing with the distribution of a dead person’s property differ greatly from Western or other sec ular law. Muslim law or Sharia is derived from the Quran and the words and traditions of Prophet Muhammad himself, and is therefore believed to be of divine inspiration and not man-made. 

7       Muslim jurisprudenc e imposes two princ ipal restric tions on testamentary power. The first restric tion c onc erns the quantum of bequests, where the rule is that a person may not dispose by will more than one-third of his property. The sec ond limitation upon testamentary power (rec ognised by all four sc hools of the Sunni Muslims, the Shafii sc hool being one amongst them) is that a testator may not make a bequest in favour of any of his legal heirs. In other words, a Muslim c annot by a testamentary disposition reduc e or enlarge the shares of those who by law are entitled to inherit (see N J Coulson, _Succession in the Muslim Family_ , (Cambridge University Press, 1971) at p 213; Asaf A A Fyzee, _Outlines of Muhammadan Law_ (3rd Ed, 1964) at p 351 and Syed Ameer Ali, _Mohammedan Law_ (6th Ed, 1965) Vol II, p 20. “Legal heir”, in the Islamic c ontext, is a term whic h is properly applied only to those relatives upon whom property devolves, after the demise of the owner, by operation of law. In Singapore, under s 111(1) of the AMLA, no Muslim domic iled in Singapore c an now dispose of his property by will exc ept in ac c ordanc e with the provisions and subjec t to the restric tions imposed by the sc hool of Muslim law professed by him. Under s 115 of the AMLA, the Syariah Court of Singapore is vested with the authority to issue the requisite inheritanc e c ertific ate, setting out the names of the legal heirs and their respec tive shares in the estate of the dec eased. Without a doubt, a legac y in favour of a legal or legitimate heir c an only take effec t with the unanimous c onsent of the c o-heirs (see Dr Ahmad Ibrahim, _Islamic Law in Malaya_ , (Malaysian Soc iologic al Researc h Institute Ltd, 1965) at p 264). 

8       Coulson c omments (at p 214) that Sunni jurisprudenc e sees the essenc e of suc c ession law to lie in protec ting the interests of the legal heirs and preserving the balanc e between their c laims as established under the sac rosanc t sc heme of inheritanc e. Bequests, however meritorious their purpose 

- in providing for c ases of partic ular hardship, in fulfilling a c haritable purpose or in performing what the testator c onc eived to be a personal duty left outstanding during his lifetime – are not allowed to defeat the entitlement of the legal heirs to at least two-thirds of the estate. 

9       Further, s 60 of the AMLA spec ific ally provides: 

 60.—(1) Whether or not made by way of will or death-bed gift, no wakaf or nazar made after 1st July 1968 and involving more than one-third of the property of the person making the same shall be valid in respect of the excess beyond such one-third. 

 (2) Every wakaf khas or nazar made after 1st July 1968 shall be null and void unless — 

 (a) the President shall have expressly sanc tioned and validated or ratified the same in writing in ac c ordanc e with the Muslim law; or 


 (b) it was made during a serious illness from whic h the maker subsequently died and was made in writing by an instrument exec uted by him and witnessed by 2 adult Muslims one of whom shall be a Kadi or Naib Kadi. 

 (3) If no Kadi or Naib Kadi is available as desc ribed in subsec tion (2)(b), any other adult Muslim who would not have been entitled to any benefic ial interests in the maker’s estate had the maker died intestate shall be a c ompetent witness. 

 (4) This sec tion shall not operate to render valid any will, death-bed gift, wakaf or nazar whic h is invalid under the provisions of the Muslim law or of any written law. 

 [emphasis added] 

**The will** 

10     The will, a subjec t matter of dispute before the c ourt, was made in the Malay language and headed in the original with the word “ _wasiat_ ”, meaning “will”. In so far as is material, the said will, translated in English and produc ed in c ourt, reads as follows: 

 Will 

 In the name of Allah, The Most Grac ious and Most Merc iful. 

 Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Universe. Salutations and peac e be upon our Prophet, Muhammad, his family and all his c ompanions. 

 I, Haji Ibrahim bin Abdul Samad (S 0257773 I) sinc erely bear witness that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger, in a state of good health and of sound mind hereby willingly and without c oerc ion from anyone divide my property into three parts and they are as follows: 

 One third of my property has already been given in a manner known as NUZRIAH (Vow). That is, my bequeath [ sic ] shall c ome into forc e three days before my death if it is due to illness, or one hour before my death if it is sudden, to the names mentioned below in ac c ordanc e with the perc entages explained thus: 

1\. My son Mohamad Taha .................... 15% 

2\. My daughter Nyaros ............... 10% 

3\. My daughter Apon ................ 10% 

4\. My daughter Zainun ............... 10% 

5\. My daughter Amida ............... 10% 

6\. My grandson Fakharuddin Arrazi Bin Mohammad Ismail .. 5% 

7\. My grandson Saiful Bahari ................................... 5% 

8\. My wife Jenab Bte Samat ..................................... 35% 


 Another one third is bequeathed as c harities to two mosques equally and whic h names are mentioned below: 

1\. Ba Alawi Mosque ... Luis Road ... Bukit Timah ... Singapore 

2\. Muhajirin Mosque ... Braddell Road ... Singapore 

 Another one third is divided in ac c ordanc e with the Faraid law (Islamic Law of Inheritanc e) to all my benefic iaries inc luding those whom I have given in a manner known as Nuzriah during my lifetime. 

 I hereby remind my c hildren, wife and all my family to be devout towards Allah and to pray to Allah to forgive me. I give my c onsent for them to pay my fasting “fidiah” (monetary payment in lieu of obligatory fasting) through their “Ihsan” (goodwill) and perform the Pilgrimage as well as the Minor Pilgrimage or perform the Sac rific ial Rites (Qurban). The handling of my body for the purpose of burial shall be c arried out in ac c ordanc e with the obligatory and c ustomary rites in Islam. 

 I hereby appoint: Mr Mohammad Taha Bin Ibrahim to be my exec utor (administrator of my will). My instruc tion in this will is pronounc ed willingly by me before two witnesses whose names and signatures appeared at the bottom.

11     Sinc e the word “bequeath”, appearing in the sec ond line of the third paragraph of the will, seemed syntac tic ally out of tune, the c ourt asked the c ounsel whether the right word should have been “bequest”. On this, the c ourt was informed by the c ourt interpreter, with the c onc urrenc e of both c ounsel, that the c orrec t word should have been “gift”. 

12     It must also be remarked at this junc ture that the exec ution of the will by the testator on 9 Dec ember 1996 was witnessed by one Syed Abdillah Aljufri (sinc e dec eased) and one Abdul Rahim Salleh. The will was also c ertified and validated by the Mufti of Singapore, Tuan Syed Isa Mohd bin 


Smith (the name “Smith” sometimes spelt as “Semait”) (“Tuan Syed Isa”) on the very date of its exec ution. It was said that the late Syed Abdillah Aljufri and the Mufti were two of the five members of the Fatwa Committee of Muis that c onsidered the validity of the will and issued a ruling subsequently on 23 February 1998. Tuan Syed Isa, who appeared in this c ase as the defendant’s expert, is still the Mufti and the c hairman of the said Committee. 

**Chronology of events** 

13     Following the demise of the testator on 14 September 1997, the defendant, who is the exec utor and trustee named in the will, engaged the legal firm of M/s Mallal & Namazie with a view to obtaining probate. The plaintiffs, on their part, engaged another firm of solic itors, M/s Palakrishnan & Partners, who after lodging a c aveat against the estate in the Registry of the Subordinate Courts, notified the other side on 17 Dec ember 1997 of their c lients’ intention to c ontest the will on the ground that the said will c ontravenes Muslim law, in that it purports to distribute only one-third and not two-thirds of the properties left behind by the testator. What happened next was that the defendant’s solic itors wrote to the Fatwa Committee of Muis for an opinion. Admittedly, neither the plaintiffs nor their solic itors were c onsulted on the text of the request. The request was also not c opied to the plaintiffs. In so far as is material, the said request reads as follows: 

 23 rd January 1998 

 We ac t for Mohammad Taha bin Ibrahim one of the lawful sons and the exec utor of the Will of the abovenamed dec eased who died on 14th September 1997. 

 We enc lose herewith a c opy of the dec eased’s Will and a c ertified translation thereof. You will note from the dec eased’s Will that same is broken up into three parts namely:

 (a) A nazar whic h relates to 1/3rd of the dec eased’s estate; 

 (b) A c haritable bequest whic h relates to 1/3rd of the dec eased’s estate; and 

 (c ) The balanc e 1/3rd to be distributed in ac c ordanc e with “Faraid”. 

 We write requesting you to let us have your views as to whether or not the nazar is a valid nazar having regard to the fac t that :

1\. Same has been duly witnessed by two persons and c ertified by the Mufti; and 

2\. The dec eased died [ _sic_ ] after suffering renal impairment and advanc ed prostrate [ _sic_ ] c anc er (he was diagnosed as suffering from prostrate [ _sic_ ] c anc er in 1996) whic h the dec eased was aware of at the time of making the Will whic h was made 9 months prior to his death. Some time in May 1997 4 months before the dec eased[’s] death he informed his exec utor about his nazar and his Will and handed him the original Will for his retention. 

 Alternatively has there been any c omplianc e with sec tion 60 (2) (a) of the Administration of Muslim Law Ac t in that sanc tion, validation or ratific ation of the nazar has been made by the President, Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura. 

 We also write requesting you to let us have your opinion as to whether in the event the nazar is valid the gift to the two mosques relates to 1/3rd of the entire property of the estate or 1/3rd of 


 the remaining two-third share therein of the estate having regard to the limit of the testamentary disposition to a 1/3rd share in Muslim estates. 

 In this event 2/3rd share in the remaining 2/3rd of the estate would be distributed in ac c ordanc e with Faraid. 

 Your urgent response would be apprec iated. 

14     The defendant’s solic itors on 23 February 1998 also wrote to the Syariah Court for the requisite inheritanc e c ertific ate and obtained the same on 2 Marc h 1998. In the said c ertific ate, it was stated by the Syariah Court that the estate of the dec eased should be divided into 104 shares and be apportioned as to 13 shares to the dec eased’s wife, 14 shares eac h to the three sons, and seven shares eac h to the seven daughters. This c ertific ate is not a subjec t of debate before the c ourt. 

15     In the event, a _fatwa_ was issued on 23 February 1998 and transmitted to the defendant’s solic itors thereafter. On 6 April 1998, the defendant’s solic itors forwarded to the plaintiffs’ solic itors the said _fatwa_ together with a c opy of the testator’s last will and the c ertific ate issued by the Syariah Court. In their letter whic h enc losed all the aforesaid doc uments, the defendant’s solic itors estimated the value of the testator’s estate to be in the region of $2.1m. 

16     The _fatwa_ issued by Muis (as translated into English) reads as follows: 

1\. The firm of Mallal & Namazie forwarded a c opy of the will made on 9th Dec ember, 1996 by the dec eased, Haji Ibrahim Bin Abdul Samad. In the will, the dec eased divided his estate into 3 parts, ie, 1/3 as nuzriah; 1/3 bequest for two mosques as stated therein and 1/3 ac c ording to faraid law. 

2\. They queried whether the nazar made in the will is valid or not and the part of the will for the two mosques is 1/3 of the whole estate or from the balanc e after distribution of nuzriah? 

3\. The Fatwa Committee opines that the nazar made in the will is valid. The 1/3 for the two mosques is from the balanc e after distribution of nuzriah. Or to make the pic ture c learer, the estate of the dec eased is divided into 27 parts as follows: 

 nuzriah 9 parts 

 legac y for the two mosques 6 parts 

 benefic iaries (distribution ac c ording to faraid) 12 parts 

 Total 27 parts 

 MUIS’s translation of para 3: 

 (The Fatwa Committee is of the opinion that ac c ording to Islam Law the nazar is valid. The gift by wasiat to the two mosques relates to 1/3 of the remaining two-third share therein of the estate. That is, the estate should be distributed as follows 

 nazar (sic ?) 9 parts 


 the c haritable bequest to the two mosques 6 parts 

 benefic iaries ac c ording to faraid 12 parts 

 Total 27 parts )

17     The plaintiffs did not ac c ept the advic e c ontained in the _fatwa_. In the meantime, two of the c hildren of the testator, Apon bte Ibrahim and Amida bte Ibrahim, both benefic iaries under the _nuzriah_ segment as well as the legal heirs segment, renounc ed their purported shares under the _nuzriah_ segment and made statutory dec larations to c onfirm their renunc iation. Although solic itors for the plaintiffs wrote to Muis expressing their c lients’ protests over the _fatwa_ whilst bringing to its attention the said renunc iations, it was to no avail. In a letter dated 28 September 1999, Muis informed the plaintiffs’ solic itors in the following terms: 

 We refer to your letter of 1 Jun 99. We would like to apologise for the late reply. 

 2 Your question was referred to the Mufti who is also the Chairman of the Fatwa Committee. Nuzriah and Will differs in the sense that the latter only take effec t after the dec eased death. The former, however, is legally effec tive in Islamic Law upon the time mentioned in the Nuzriah. 

 3 Nuzriah does not c onstitute a Will or form part of a Will, whic h rightfully should be alloc ated 1/3 of the whole estate and not more. Nuzriah, on the other hand, has no maximum limit. Drawing up a Nuzriah and a Will at the same time from one partic ular person does not c ontravene the Islamic Law, even if the total shares exc eeded 1/3 of the total estate. 

 4 Our Fatwa issued on 3 Aug 98, c learly stated that the Nuzriah is still valid despite a party or the whole parties’ disc laim over the Nuzriah’s shares. Thus, despite her statutory dec laration, the person Apon Binte Ibrahim is still c onsidered as the rightful and legal owner of the shares mentioned in the Nuzriah and if she wishes to disc laim it, she may give the shares to any party that she wishes to. 

18     As the events unfolded, the plaintiffs filed this originating summons on 24 August 2001. The applic ation was amended on 11 September 2001 seeking the following orders: 

1\. a dec laration that the Will of Haji Ibrahim bin Abdul Samad alias Nordin bin Samat, dec eased, dated 9th Dec ember 1996 is valid only ac c ording to Islamic law of inheritanc e (Faraid) as regards the bequeaths [ _sic_ ] to the 2 mosques stated therein as it is within one-third of the estate of the testator but the remaining two-thirds share would be divided amongst the lawful benefic iaries of the dec eased in ac c ordanc e with the Certific ate of Inheritanc e issued by the Syariah Court of Singapore dated 2nd Marc h 1998; 

2\. further, a dec laration that paragraph 3 of the Will purporting to bequeath on the 


 Testator’s property before his death in a manner known as NUZRIAH, be void; 

3\. that the Defendant shall not distribute the assets of the estate to those listed in para 3 of the said Will of Haji Ibrahim bin Abdul Samad alias Nordin bin Samat, dec eased; 

4\. c osts for the Plaintiffs; 

5\. any other orders or direc tions as deemed fit by the Honourable Court. 

19     There is one further detail that requires mention here. On 5 April 2002, Haji Maarof bin Haji Salleh, the then President of Muis, issued a belated ratific ation of the _nuzriah_ segment of the will. The said letter, exhibited in the affidavit of the defendant filed on 9 April 2002, reads as follows: 

 I have read the c opy of the doc ument attac hed hereto entitled “WASIAT” whic h was exec uted by the Dec eased on 9 Dec 1996. 

 The said doc ument c ontains a “Nuzriah” over 1/3rd of the Dec eased’s assets. 

 I hereby sanc tion, validate and/or ratify the said “Nuzriah” in ac c ordanc e with sec tion 60(2)(a) of the Administration of Muslim Law Ac t (Chapter 3, 1999 Revised Edition). 

**Evidence and arguments** 

20     As c ould be seen from the foregoing will, there are three segments: the first c onc erns the muc h c ontested _nuzriah_ , the sec ond pertains to two named mosques and the third deals with the purported shares of the legal heirs. Although there were a number of affidavits filed by the parties to this litigation raising a number of disputed fac ts, oral and c ross-examination, by c hoic e, were c onfined only to one expert eac h. The expert for the plaintiffs is Dr Ismail bin Mohd (alias Abu Hassan), an Assistant Professor from the International Islamic University of Malaysia. His opinion is c ontained in three affidavits filed by him, on 22 Oc tober 2001, 3 June 2002 and 20 January 2003. The defendant’s expert is Tuan Syed Isa. He is none other than the Mufti of Singapore, the one who had validated the will of the testator on the day it was made and the one who presided over the Fatwa Committee later and gave a view in favour of the defendant. His opinion is c ontained in three affidavits filed by him on 8 April 2002, 3 Oc tober 2002 and 24 April 2004 respec tively. Both witnesses testified in person and were questioned extensively. The signific ant aspec ts of their evidenc e c an be rec apitulated as follows. 

**_Plaintiffs’ expert’s evidence_** 

21     In Dr Ismail’s opinion, the _nuzriah_ segment, whereby the testator purported to give one-third of his estate to a number of legal heirs, is invalid under the laws of Islam. Dr Ismail said that the term “ _nuzriah_ ” c ould not be found in any of the books or treatises published by Muslim jurists. However, the word “ _nazar_ ” (vow) appears in several textbooks and foremost amongst them is Nawawi’s _Minhaj et Talibin (A Manual of Muhammadan Law According to the School of Shafii)_ (W Thac ker & Co, 1914). Ac c ording to Nawawi (see pp 495–499), and annotated in Dr Ahmad Ibrahim’s _Islamic Law in Malaya_ ([7] _supra_ at pp 281–282): 

 Vows are of two kinds— 

1\. A vow with a penalty, c onsisting, _eg_ , in the following words:— “If I speak to him I engage before God to fast,” or “to enfranc hise a slave.” If not kept this vow obliges the person 


 formulating it to ac c omplish the expiation presc ribed for perjury, or, ac c ording to one authority, to ac c omplish the expiatory ac tion promised. A single authority gives the person who owes expiation a c hoic e between the expiation for perjury and the expiatory ac t promised. [It is to this latter doc trine I give the preferenc e, as do the jurists of Irak.] On the other hand, a person who says, “If I enter suc h-and-suc h a house I engage to perform the expiation presc ribed for perjury[”], need only undergo the expiation for perjury. 

2\. A vow of gratitude, c onsisting in an engagement towards God to ac quit oneself of some good work in the hope of obtaining from Him some favour or of avoiding some c alamity. This vow may be formulated, for example, in the following terms:— “If God heals my sic kness I engage to ac c omplish before Him suc h-and-suc h an ac t,” or “I engage to perform suc h-and-suc h an ac tion.” A promise suc h as this should be ac c omplished if the event hoped for takes plac e, _ie_ if the c ondition is fulfilled. The ac c omplishment of the promise is obligatory even where it is not made dependent upon a c ondition, for example, if one says, “I engage before God to fast.” 

 A vow may not have for its objec t an ac tion that is unjust or that is already obligatory. A person who vows to perform some indifferent ac tion, or to abstain from it, need not keep his engagement, provided he ac quits himself of the expiation for perjury, at least ac c ording to the theory whic h is to be preferred. 

22     Ac c ording to Dr Ismail, the portion purportedly given away by the testator under the name “ _nuzriah_ ” does not seem to fit, even in the least, the examples and illustrations c ited by Nawawi and Ahmad Ibrahim in their books, nor does the term c onform or ac c ord with the princ iples underlying the doc trine of _nazar_ expounded in those writings. He said that, to the best of his knowledge and researc h, this _nuzriah_ , as it is c harac terised by the defendant’s expert, is not known nor prac tised in Indonesia, Malaysia or any part of the Muslim world of the Shafii sc hool. After dealing with the general princ iples of the Muslim law of inheritanc e and some unique features of Muslim jurisprudenc e relating to (a) “ _wakaf_ ” (sometimes spelt as “ _waqf_ ”) whic h means a permanent dedic ation by a Muslim of any movable or immovable property for any purpose rec ognised by Muslim law as pious, religious or c haritable, (b) “ _wasiyyah_ ” (sometimes spelt as “ _wasiyya_ ”, “ _wasiyyat_ ” or “ _wasiat_ ”), meaning bequest or will, and (c ) “ _hibah_ ” or “ _hiba_ ”, meaning gift, Dr Ismail said (see paras 29 to 32 of his opinion, referred to in the plaintiffs’ affidavit of 22 Oc tober 2001): 

29\. ... A Muslim who leaves heirs c annot dispose by will of more than one-third of what remains of his estate after payment of funeral expenses and debts. The remaining two-thirds of the estate are distributed ac c ording to the inheritanc e law among his heirs. 

30\. It is c lear that the Will made by Haji Ibrahim as to limit one third of his property to be divided ac c ording to the system of _faraid_ is in c ontradic tion to the princ iple of _faraid_. (See para 29). The legal heirs will take their portion of inheritanc e ac c ording to their quantum of entitlement only after the settlement of all nec essary rights as previously mentioned. The remainder c an either be less or more than one third of the whole estate. 

31\. It c an be notic ed that Haji Ibrahim’ Will, to some extent, disregards the Muhammadan     Law and offends it by purporting to bequest his estate by way of _nuzriyyah_ , _waqf_ or c haritable bequest ( _sadaqah_ ), and limiting one third to be divided ac c ording to _faraid_. The fac t is that the     Will is void to the extent of its inc onsistenc y with the tenets of _shariah_ and to the extent of its _ultra vires_ with the right of the legal heirs. Meaning to say that the bequeathable third is valid and any exc eeding portion is invalid subjec t to the c onsent of the legal heirs. If someone bequeaths half or the whole property of his estate to the non-legal heir eg his adopted son, it may not render the will to be void, it is valid to the bequeathable third only. Any exc eeding 


 amount, whic h is ultra vires to the legal heirs, is subjec t to their c onsent. But, if he bequeaths that one of his son [ sic ] should be exc luded from the entitlement of inheritanc e, the will is void sinc e the son is the legal heir. Therefore, the Will of Haji Ibrahim, c annot in any way to be said void ab initio , as we have to sc rutinize it sinc e the shariah has drawn a way to harmonize the wish of the proprietor (the dec eased) and the welfare of the legal heirs. 

32\. In the light of the above analysis, it is hereby submitted that the gift ( _hibah_ ) made in the Will by way of _nuzriyyah_ does not c omply with the princ iples of gift ( _hibah_ ), nor does it c onsistent [ _sic_ ] to the princ iples of _nazar_ or _nuzriyyah_. It is c overed and should be regulated by the princ iple of bequest whereby only two persons who are non legal heirs may entitle for the portion. The waqf or c haritable bequest (sadaqah) is valid but subjec t to the princ iple of bequest (wasiyyah). Therefore, both the _nuzriyyah_ and the _waqf_ or c haritable bequest ( _sadaqah_ ) should subjec t to the princ iple of the bequeathable third. The Will as to divide the remainder (1/3) purported by the testator ac c ording to _faraid_ is tantamount to the princ iple of _faraid_ itself and bequest, and therefore should be disregarded. 

**_Defendant’s expert’s evidence_** 

23     Tuan Syed Isa’s opinion, in so far as is material, as c ontained in his first affidavit filed on 9 April 2002, is as follows: 

6\. Firstly, I wish to state that nuzriahs are prac tised among Muslims of the Shafei sec t. Nuzriahs ac tually originate from nazars and c an be c onsidered to be a form of nazars. 

7\. Sec ondly, although the doc ument exec uted by the Dec eased is entitled “Wasiat”, whic h roughly means “Bequest”, the Nuzriah c reated by the Dec eased is supposed to take effec t 3 days before the Dec eased’s death, or 1 hour before his death in the c ase of a sudden death. The     Nuzriah is therefore a transac tion made during the life of the Dec eased, and it c annot be c lassified as a bequest, ie wasiyyah. Ac c ordingly, the Muslim law of bequests, ie Wasiat, c annot apply to the Nuzriah. 

8\. Sinc e the Nuzriah was made during the life of the Dec eased, it follows that the Muslim law of suc c ession, i.e. faraid, is not applic able to the Nuzriah. 

9\. Furthermore, a nuzriah must be distinguished from a hiba, i.e. gift. Conc eptually, a nuzriah is distinc t from a hiba. Therefore, the Muslim law c onc erning hibas c annot be applied to nuzriahs. 

10\. Ac c ording to the opinion of Imam Nawawi, one may make a nazar to perform any work, provided that it is not obligatory upon him, suc h as looking after a sic k person, ac c ompanying a funeral to the grave or making a salutation. 

11\. Both of the Plaintiffs’ experts are of the opinion that the Nuzriah c reated by the     Dec eased by his will dated 9 Dec ember 1996 is invalid under Muslim law. In the c ase of Asst     Professor Dr Ismail bin Mohd, the objec tions raised by him to the Nuzriah c an be summarised as follows: 

 a. The Dec eased had already bequeathed 1/3rd of his assets to the mosques. To allow him to bequeath any further part of his assets by way of the Nuzriah would infringe the 1/3rd rule and be c ontrary to faraid (see paras 30-31 of his Opinion). 


 b. As a bequest (“wasiat”), the Nuzriah would infringe the rule that prohibits a bequest to legal heirs beyond their entitlement under faraid (see para 11 of his Opinion). 

 c. As a gift (“hiba”), the Nuzriah would infringe the rule that a gift must be c ompleted by transfer of title or ownership to the donees. It is invalid exc ept for 2 donees (see paras 10, 15 of his Opinion). Also, it infringes the rule that the gift must treat c lose relatives equally (see para 14 of his Opinion). 

 d. The Nuzriah per se does not fulfil the requirements for a nazar and does not fall within the divisions mentioned or c larified by Nawawi (see para 13 of his Opinion). 

12\. Based on the princ iples I have mentioned above, my response to Asst Professor Dr Ismail bin Mohd’s opinion is as follows: 

 a. Sinc e the Nuzriah is a transac tion made during the life of the Dec eased, the 1/3rd rule is not applic able. The Nuzriah is not part of the distribution of the Dec eased’s estate upon his death. 

 b. Sinc e the Nuzriah is a transac tion made during the life of the Dec eased, it c annot be treated as a bequest. The rule that prohibits a bequest to legal heirs beyond their entitlement under faraid is therefore not applic able. 

 c. The Nuzriah is not a hiba and must not be treated as one. It follows that the rules of hiba are not applic able. 

 d. There is no basis for saying that the Nuzriah does not fall within the divisions mentioned or c larified by Nawawi. 

24     In his testimony, Tuan Syed Isa maintained that the giving away of property by an individual by way of _nuzriah_ , as was done in the will of the testator, is not new to Singapore; Muis has registered 36 suc h _nuzriah_ sinc e 1997 and the prac tic e is at least 500 years old. In this regard, referenc e was made by him to an Arabic c ompilation with the title _Bugyat ul Mustarsyideen (The Aspiration of the Seekers of Guidance)_ , put together by a muc h respec ted Mufti of Hadramout, Sayyid Abdul Rahman bin Muhammad bin Hussain bin Umar Al Masyhuur Ba’alawie. This work is reported to c ontain the differing viewpoints of two well-known religious sc holars and the summary of some edic ts by Ibn Ziyad. The extrac ts referred to the c ourt by Tuan Syed Isa will be referred to later in this judgment. 

25     Tuan Syed Isa said that the doc trine of _Nazar_ is rooted in a verse from the Quran (Sura 76: verse 7 ( _Dahr_ , or Time, or _Insan_ , or Man), reproduc ed in Yusuf Ali’s _The Glorious Quran – Translation and Commentary_ , (2nd Ed, 1977) whic h reads: 

 They perform (their) vows, And they fear a Day Whose evil flies far and wide. 

26     Tuan Syed Isa, in his testimony, said that the property, delineated as _nuzriah_ by the testator, should not be regarded as a bequest and c onsequently did not offend the laws of inheritanc e under Muslim law bec ause the said segment was given away during the testator’s lifetime, although it was to take effec t three days before the death of the testator in c ase of illness, or one hour before death, if death were to oc c ur suddenly. Tuan Syed Isa also expressed his view that the 


portion ear-marked as _nuzriah_ by the testator c ould not be regarded under Muslim law as _hiba_ (gift) bec ause of the absenc e of ac tual delivery by the donor and ac c eptanc e by the donees of the subjec t matter. He further c laimed that the _nuzriah_ portion bec ame vested in the benefic iaries named under the said segment on 9 Dec ember 1996 itself, the very day the will was exec uted. 

27     Tuan Syed Isa was asked why the testator was still seen to be holding on to the property said to be divested if the _nuzriah_ portion was indeed divested by the testator as on 9 Dec ember 1996 by dec laring that “my bequeath [ _sic_ ] [gift] shall c ome into forc e three days before my death if it is due to illness, or one hour before my death if it is sudden”. Tuan Syed Isa replied, “Ac tually your Honour, when _nazar_ is made, he [the testator] should implement it right away, immediately ... Yes, it should be given physic ally.” Another highlight in his testimony was that although the testator had under his will divided his estate into three equal parts, the distribution in equal parts to all three segments would offend the Muslim law of inheritanc e, henc e resulting in the Fatwa Committee’s apportionment of the estate as to nine parts to the _nuzriah_ segment, six parts to the mosques segment and 12 parts to the legal heirs segment. 

28     Tuan Syed Isa mentioned further that, on 9 Dec ember 1996, when the testator appeared at the Muis offic es for his will to be witnessed and c onsequently to be c ertified, Tuan Syed Isa’s c onversation with the testator was brief and there was no disc ussion or inquiry c onc erning why the testator was demarc ating a portion of his estate by way of _nuzriah_. He disc losed that although there were several suc h _nuzriah_ registered with Muis, this was the first c ase where a _fatwa_ was requested. He also disc losed that the deliberation by the Fatwa Committee lasted for about 30 minutes. In relation to the implic ations of s 60 of the AMLA ([9] _supra_ ), the c ourt c ould not get muc h input from Tuan Syed Isa, sinc e c ounsel for the defendant rose to say that Tuan Syed Isa was c alled to c ourt to testify only in relation to Muslim law and he would be ill-equipped to handle questions on statutory provisions. This was most unfortunate, sinc e a _fatwa_ issued without an understanding of s 60 of the AMLA whic h, amongst other things spec ific ally deals with _nazar_ , is, in my view, bound to be defic ient as we shall see later. Tuan Syed Isa, however, c onc eded that there was no agreed view amongst sc holars c onc erning the partic ular prac tic e of _nazar_ or _nuzriah_. 

29     Tuan Syed Isa also stated that even if a person were to give away his entire estate by way of _nuzriah_ to any of his preferred legal heirs, it was lawful and valid ac c ording to Muslim law. This view is a reiteration of a statement c ontained in the letter dated 28 September 1999 ([17] _supra_ ) from Muis addressed to the plaintiffs’ solic itors, whic h reads: 

 Nuzriah, on the other hand, has no maximum limit. Drawing up a Nuzriah and a Will at the same time from one partic ular person does not c ontravene the Islamic Law, even if the total shares exc eeded 1/3 of the total estate. 

**Arguments in a nutshell** 

30     Lengthy arguments were presented by both c ounsel, c ontending for the opposites. I do not propose to rehearse them here at length and they will be referred to later in this judgment, if need be. In essenc e, the argument by the plaintiffs’ c ounsel was that the _nuzriah_ segment is invalid; it is repugnant to the princ iples of Muslim law and the apportionment attempted by the Fatwa Committee is not c onsonant with the plain language of the will, whic h c alls for equal portions to all three segments. Counsel for the defendant, on the other hand, c ontended that the _nuzriah_ is well entrenc hed in Singapore; the wording of the will is suc h that the said segment c annot be regarded as a bequest; and the division re-done by the Fatwa Committee was to give effec t to the princ iples of Muslim law. Defendant’s c ounsel further submitted that the issue whether the _nuzriah_ is valid or not had been c onsidered by the Fatwa Committee and, although the ruling is not binding on this c ourt, it

## [2]

## [6] 


must, nonetheless, be ac c orded the weight it deserves. He added further that in the event the c ourt were to hold that the _nuzriah_ is invalid, no issue of apportionment between the _nuzriah_ and the mosques segment arises and that the mosques segment should rec eive the entire one-third share. 

**Decision** 

31     A princ ipal restric tion in Muslim law, as has been dec lared in all the authoritative works and treatises, and referred to in s 114 of the AMLA, is that a testator is not entitled to dispose of more than one-third of the property belonging to him at the time of death, and that the residue of his property must desc end in fixed proportions to his legal heirs unless c onsent is given by all legal heirs to any deviation from the rule. In Singapore, under s 115 of the AMLA, the Syariah Court is c harged with the responsibility of issuing the requisite inheritanc e c ertific ate setting out the said fixed proportion of eac h heir. 

32     The princ iples stated above have been c onsistently re-affirmed in several reported c ases in Singapore and Malaysia, both before and after the c oming into forc e of the AMLA. 

33     In _Shaik Abdul Latif v Shaik Elias Bux_ (1915) 1 FMSLR 204, the appeal c ourt held (as stated in the headnote of the report): 

 [U]nder Mohammedan Law a testator has the power to dispose of not more than one-third of the property belonging to him at the time of death; and that the residue of suc h property must desc end in fixed proportions to those dec lared by Mohammedan Law to be his heirs unless the heirs c onsent to a deviation from this rule ... 

34     The foregoing view was amplified in _Siti binti Yatim v Mohamed Nor bin Bujai_ (1928) 6 FMSLR 135, where the High Court held that the will of a Muslim whic h attempts to prefer one heir by giving him a larger share of the estate than he is entitled to by Muslim law is wholly invalid as to suc h bequest without the c onsent of the other heirs. 

35     The High Court in Singapore also has affirmed the above-stated princ iples in a number of c ases (see: _Re Fatimah Binte Mohamed Bin Ali Al Tway, Deceased_ [1933] 1 MLJ 211 (“ _Re Fatimah_ ”); _Abdul Jabbar v M Mohamed Abubacker_ [1940] 1 MLJ 286 – although this c ase involved a Hanafi, the applic able princ iples are nonetheless the same in relation to bequests; and _Re Estate of Siti bte Naydeen_ [1984–1985] SLR 468). I shall revert to _Re Fatimah_ later in this judgment. 

36     Returning to the issues before this c ourt, the first question relates to whether the property purportedly given away by the testator as _nuzriah_ is a bequest, gift or a valid _nazar_. The plaintiffs’ c ontention is that it is a bequest that offends the Muslim law on inheritanc e. The defendant, whilst saying that it is not a gift, maintains that it is a _nuzriah_ , whic h is something given during the life of the testator. 

37     It must be remarked at the outset that the phraseology used by the testator in the will, partic ularly in relation to the _nuzriah_ segment, lends itself to muc h diffic ulty and c onfusion. First, the doc ument is headed as “ _wasiat_ ”, meaning “will”. Next, the doc ument, as translated and produc ed to the c ourt, appears on the fac e of it to present itself either as a bequest or a gift. The operative words are: “my bequeath [ _sic_ ]”. The word “bequeath” is plainly a wrong rendering of the relevant Malay word in the original doc ument. It is either “bequest”, “bequeathal” or some other word. The c ourt interpreter said that the c orrec t translation is “gift”. The defendant’s side, not surprisingly, shies away from both the words, for if, indeed, it is a bequest, the said segment substantially bec omes void, unless c onsented to by all the legal heirs; if it is, on the other hand, a gift, there is no 

## [7] 


running away from the fac t that in the absenc e of delivery and ac c eptanc e, the segment also fails. So the question is: Could this be a valid _nazar_? 

38     The c onc ept of _nazar_ , as desc ribed by Nawawi and other writers, is of two kinds: a vow with a penalty or a vow of gratitude. The _nazar_ or _nuzriah_ as mentioned in the will, is c ertainly not one of penalty. Is it then a vow of gratitude? The defendant’s expert, Tuan Syed Isa, c laims that the present _nuzriah_ is one of good deed or c harity, implying that it is more akin to a vow of gratitude. But where is the evidenc e to underpin suc h a c laim? As it stands, the will is unhelpful and silent as to the bac kdrop of any suc h vow. Tuan Syed Isa, who attended to the testator at the time the will was exec uted, was also unable to throw any light on the bac kground sinc e he neither inquired nor was told by the testator of the reasons why this _nuzriah_ was made. 

39     Tuan Syed Isa, in his evidenc e, said that _nuzriah_ is a minor _nazar_ and the c onc ept of _nazar_ is anc hored in the Quranic verse (Sura 76, verse 7, [25] _supra_ ). In this regard, it is instruc tive to make referenc e to p 1656 of Yusuf Ali’s _The Glorious Quran — Translation and Commentary_ ([25] _supra_ ), where the author appends a footnote to the said verse (n 5837), whic h reads as follows: 

 The vows must be vows of spiritual servic e, whic h of c ourse inc ludes servic e to humanity, suc h as is mentioned in the next verse [Sura 76, verse 8]. They are Devotees of God, and they must perform all vows and c ontrac ts [Sura 5, verse 1 and n 682]. ... 

40     Looking at the will objec tively, it is diffic ult to disc ern any c ontent of spiritual servic e, servic e to humanity or any existing obligation to fulfil a c ontrac t in the _nuzriah_ segment. On the fac e of it, it appears to be no more than a direc tion by the testator to give an additional portion of his estate to some of his c hildren and grandc hildren. It is c learly an expression of preferenc e. If the portion delineated was given away during his lifetime by the testator to the named benefic iaries, it would have c onstituted a gift _inter vivos_ and the plaintiffs would not have been in a position to c hallenge the said direc tion, for there is no legal impediment in Muslim law for a person to give away any amount of his wealth or assets during his lifetime. But in the c ase at hand, c ontrary to the assertion of the defendant’s expert witness, the property is not divested by the testator on 9 Dec ember 1996, bec ause of the testator’s express stipulation that his “bequeath [ _sic_ ]” or gift shall c ome into forc e only three days before his death in c ase of illness and one hour before his death if it is sudden. 

41     In my evaluation, with the greatest respec t to Tuan Syed Isa and his undoubted piety and sinc erity, his analysis does not stand up to sc rutiny. Let me elaborate. 

42     Tuan Syed Isa mentioned that the _nuzriah_ is not new to Singapore and it goes a long way bac k. In this regard, he also made referenc e to an anec dote c ited as “c ase F” in _Bugyat ul Mustarsyideen_ ([24] _supra_ ), of a person making a c onditional “ _nadzr_ ” ( _nazar_ ) “in favour of his daughter to give her jewellery that [was] in her keeping and to give money to the rest of the c hildren that is to take effec t three days before his death if he dies of sic kness and an hour before his death if he dies a sudden death”. The said anec dote is immediately followed by the sentenc e: “Both the ‘nadzrs’ are valid.” 

43     Whilst I do not propose to sec ond-guess the sc holarship and erudition c ontained in the said c ommentary, it should be remarked at onc e that the c over of this c ommentary itself exhibits a c aveat that the work c ontains not a single point of view but the differing viewpoints of two well-respec ted _shaiks_ (leaders). In any event, the translation produc ed to the c ourt is so mangled that it is very diffic ult to deduc e any c entral princ iple with a measure of c ertainty. 

44     Counsel for the defendant, through Tuan Syed Isa, invited the c ourt’s attention to yet 

## [8] 


another Arabic treatise, _Syarh ul Yaquut un Nafees (Commentary on the Precious Ruby)_ by Muhammad bin Ahmad Asy Syatiri. A translation of pp 432 to 434 from the third volume of the book, c ontains the following: 

 A c ommon sc enario is a vow (nadzr) in favour of some c hildren with the exc lusion of others. This is an area of differenc e amongst the sc holars but we must apprec iate that a man may have a number of c hildren and amongst them a small c hild and so he bequeaths part of his wealth by way of a nadzr in favour of the small c hild for he has already married off the older ones and this one he has not married him off or bec ause he is unable to support himself. Is suc h a nadzr valid? They (sc holars) have said that if he selec ted some benefic iaries and exc luded others and he intends to deprive, there are strong differenc es in it. Ibn Hajr said that it is permissible outwardly even though he may intend to deprive but if he does not intend to deprive but rather that one of them (c hildren) possesses exc ellenc e in knowledge or goodness or piety, is this nadzr valid? They (sc holars) have said that it is valid but there are sc holars who have ruled that it is invalid even in this sc enario and amongst them is Ibn Ziyad and others from the sc holars of Yemen but Ibn Hajr and others have ruled that it is valid. ... However if there is a differenc e between the two c ategories like c hildren and brethren, if one makes a nadzr in favour of his brothers and exc ludes his c hildren, the nadzr is unanimously valid. 

45     The passage c ited above, in my view, shows that, at best, not all but a few hold the view that a vow in favour of some c hildren over others may be valid in some exc eptional c irc umstanc es suc h as nec essity and want of support. Furthermore, that passage also underlines that there are strong differenc es amongst the sc holars as regards the vow illustrated. There is no indic ation from the said passage that sc holars have an agreed position to give validity to the vow. There is c learly an absenc e of c onsensus or _Ijmaa_ and in the premises, the passage c ited does not seem to advanc e the stand-point of the defendant. 

**_Nuzriah_** **: Bequest, gift or something else? When does it vest?** 

46     It is an unc ontested position that if the first segment of the will, styled as a _nuzriah_ , were to be regarded as a bequest, it would doubtless run c ounter to the princ iples of Muslim law c onc erning inheritanc e. The plaintiffs’ position is that from whic hever angle you look at the so-c alled _nuzriah_ , it is nothing but a bequest. Counsel for the defendant argues, on the other hand, that it is neither a bequest nor a gift but a devic e of its own genre, prac tised over a long period of time and had presently rec eived a stamp of approval from the Fatwa Committee. To rec all the words of Tuan Syed Isa in paras 6 to 8 of his affidavit filed on 8 April 2002, it is a transac tion made during the life of the testator; it c annot be c lassified as a bequest, nor c ould it be c onsidered a gift. He also ventured to suggest that a Muslim c ould give away the entire portion of his estate by way of _nuzriah_ to a preferred heir and that would be valid ac c ording to Muslim law. 

47     Counsel for the plaintiffs invited my attention to _Re Fatimah_ ([35] _supra_ ), a dec ision by the High Court of the Straits Settlements dealing with an Arabic doc ument purporting to be a “ _nasr_ ” (same as the present _nuzriah_ or _nazar_ ). The judgment of Sproule ACJ at 211–212 bears reproduc tion almost in full. It reads thus: 

 The position appears to be that Testatrix wished to make this gift but she or her relatives and advisers were doubtful whether by so doing she might not exc eed the power of disposition of more than one third of her Estate without the c onsent of her heirs as required by Mohamedan Law. They appear to have hit upon the solution of a fic tion nasr to save testatrix from all danger of disc onforming from the law of Islam. 


 A Nasr is a kind of bargain with the Almighty. A donor vows, c onditionally upon rec overy from an illness, or the fulfilment of some other dear wish, that he will make a gift, it may be a sac rific ial offering, it may be to c harity or to some individual for the sake of God. If the heart’s wish be granted then the vow in God’s name bec omes irrevoc able by a devout Mohamedan. 

 In our c ase there is no evidenc e of any prayer for the granting of any dear wish, nor of the vouc hsafing of that prayer. There is moreover no evidenc e of a vow, made in advanc e, to bec ome binding c onditionally upon the granting of any suc h prayer. There appear to be no more than the legal fic tion of a nasr intended to ensure a devout Mohamedan from possibly infringing the restric tion plac ed by the Islamic law upon disposition of wasihat. 

 The nasr , moreover appears to c all for performanc e of the gift immediately, irrevoc ably and inter vivos. ... The gift is to be deemed to be of effec t three days before her death if natural one day before, if sudden. 

 It is very c lear to me that in neither c ase c ould the gift ac tually take effec t at all exc ept after and by reason of the donor’s death. ... 

 For these reasons and upon the fac ts as I see them I hold that Testatrix really intended by this instrument to make a testamentary disposition, that her gift was revoc able and that it is expressed and was intended only to take effec t c onditionally upon and by reason of and subsequent to her own death. I add that even in form it appears suffic iently to c onform to our Wills Ordinanc e. 

 For these reasons I dec ide this issue in favour of Syed Sallim, and hold that here was a good Codic il and a good testamentary disposition. I give c osts to both parties out of the general residue, to be taxed as between Solic itor and Client, I add that the fear of Testatrix’s amateur legal advisers appears to be groundless and that her Will and Codic il together do not after all appear in fac t or quantum to transgress the prohibition of Mohamedan Law against disposal by Will of more than one third of a Testator’s Estate, although as I have stated the transgression in a c ase like ours of suc h a prohibition would not invalidate the Will. 

 I send the Petition bac k to the Registrar for formal proof of exec ution of the Codic il and a grant of Probate ac c ordingly. 

48     It is c lear from the reasoning of Sproule ACJ that the “ _nasr_ ” made by the dec eased in _Re Fatimah_ is a testamentary disposition and takes effec t “after and by reason of the donor’s death”. This dec ision, no doubt, weakens the very foundation of the defendant’s c ontention that the present _nuzriah_ takes effec t from the day it was made and that it c annot be regarded as a bequest. 

49     Proc eeding further, the testimony of Tuan Syed Isa, reaffirming a statement by the Fatwa Committee in its letter dated 28 September 1999 ([17] _supra_ ) that _nuzriah_ has no maximum limit and drawing up a _nuzriah_ and a will at the same time by one partic ular person does not c ontravene Muslim law even if the total shares exc eeded one-third of the total estate, does not seem to c ohere with the letter and spirit of s 60(1) of the AMLA, whic h states that whether or not made by way of will or death-bed gift, no _wakaf_ or _nazar_ made after 1 July 1968 and involving more than one-third of the property of the person making the same shall be valid in respec t of the exc ess beyond suc h one-third. 

50     Counsel for the defendant seems to suggest – although he is a little ambivalent in this regard – that the restric tion under s 60 of the AMLA applies only to “ _nazar am_ ” (a _nazar_ intended wholly or in part for the benefit of the Muslim c ommunity generally or part thereof as opposed to an 

## [9] 


individual or individuals – see s 2 of the AMLA) and not to a private _nazar_. I must remark immediately that this submission is c learly erroneous. 

51     In my view, s 60 of the AMLA does not make any distinc tion between private and public _nazar_. The argument that the legislature, by enac ting the said sec tion, merely intended to impose a one-third restric tion to _nazar_ of a public nature and not to private _nazar_ is plainly unsustainable. There is absolutely no juridic al basis for the legislature to put in plac e a one-third limit only to a _nazar_ of a public nature and exempt the private _nazar_ from suc h a limit. In my opinion, the language of s 60 of AMLA leaves no room for ambiguity. It was put in plac e to reinforc e a fundamental Sharia doc trine that a Muslim c an only give away, either by way of will or death-bed gift, one-third of his estate as _nazar_ or _wakaf_. The doc trine of death-sic kness and death-bed gift (“ _mard al-maut_ ” or “ _mardulmawt_ ” or “ _mar-zul maut_ ”) is not in issue in this c ase. However, for the benefit of those who are not familiar with Muslim law, I should add that the doc trine of death-sic kness or death-bed gift is c onc erned with the legal effec t of transac tions entered into by persons in their death-sic kness (see Coulson, [7] _supra_ , at p 259; Fyzee, [7] _supra_ , at pp 363 and 364). 

52     It is also ironic that the defendant, through his solic itors, applied to Muis and c aused its former President, Haji Maarof Salleh, to ratify the present private _nazar_ or _nuzriah_ on 5 April 2002 under s 60 of the AMLA. If the said sec tion is applic able, as is being c ontended now, only to public _nazar_ or _nazar am_ , why were steps taken by the plaintiffs to ratify a private _nazar_? The attempted explanation by c ounsel that it was an exerc ise in error is found by me to be weak and c ontradic tory. 

53     Returning to the wording of the _nuzriah_ segment in the will, although it reads that the “property has already been given”, it was not in fac t given away at the time of exec ution, sinc e the testator qualifies the foregoing with a stipulation that his “bequeath [ _sic_ ]” shall c ome into forc e three days before death in c ase of illness and one hour before death, if sudden. Death, no doubt, is the only c ertainty. But c an any one predic t beforehand with any degree of c ertainty that the death of someone will oc c ur on a partic ular date and hour? The fic tion devised, with great respec t to its authors, poses a puzzle of epic proportions that no mere mortal c an ever hope to solve. In this regard, I should c ommend Tuan Syed Isa for his c andidness when he c onc eded that whatever property a person intends to give away by way of _nazar_ should be given away immediately without any postponement. 

54     There is one further point on this subjec t. In the c ourse of his evidenc e, Tuan Syed Isa was asked whether invoc ation of the name of God was not an essential pre-requisite for any valid _nazar_. His attention in this respec t was drawn to a passage at p 259 (n 5) of _A Digest of Moohummudan Law_ (Smith Elder and Co, 1865) by Neil B E Baillie (one of the authoritative books c ommended in s 114 of the AMLA), whic h reads: 

 The nuzr [ nazar ] is properly a vow taken for God’s sake, to do something that is good, or abstain from something that is evil. A man has said, “If I rec over from this sic kness, I will sac rific e a sheep,” and he does rec over; yet nothing is inc umbent on him, unless he had said, “If I rec over, then for the sake of God I am under an obligation to sac rific e.” Fut Al , vol ii p 92. 

Baillie c ites in this regard _Futuwa Alumgeere_ (vol ii, p 92), a c elebrated digest of Muslim law prepared by the c ommand of the Emperor Aurung-zebe of India, during the Moghul period. Tuan Syed Isa’s reply, in this regard, was that a formal invoc ation of God’s name is not nec essary to c onstitute a valid _nazar_ or _nuzriah_ by its maker and that the invoc ation is implic it in the very pronounc ement of the word “ _nazar_ ” or “ _nuzriah_ ”. Although the views expressed by Baillie in his book as well as by Sproule ACJ in _Re Fatimah_ do not seem to sit well with the c omments made by Tuan Syed Isa, I am of 

## [10] 


the view that this is a matter eminently suitable for disc ussion by Muslim sc holars at a later time and a ruling one way or the other is not c ruc ial to the resolution of the dispute at hand. 

**Fatwa Committee deliberations** 

55     There are many troubling questions c onc erning the manner in whic h the will of the testator c ame to be c ertified, validated and subsequently ratified. Although no negative motive c an be attributed to Tuan Syed Isa, his validation of the will on the day it was exec uted and his predisposition in favour of its c onstruc tion should have effec tively ruled him out from partaking in the deliberation of the Fatwa Committee that upheld its validity. It is an important princ iple of Western as well as Muslim jurisprudenc e that a person c annot be a judge in his own c ause. Whilst I ac c ept that Tuan Syed Isa has no interest to protec t nor any axe to grind with any partic ular party, his c hairing the Fatwa Committee and issuing a c onfirmatory ruling under his hand and seal later, in support of his earlier held view, indeed tend to present the proc ess in a somewhat lesser light. In this c onnec tion, it is instruc tive to refer to a rec ent dec ision by the House of Lords in _Davidson v Scottish Ministers_ [2004] UKHL 34, reported in _The Times_ of 16 July 2004, where it was held that a risk of apparent bias was liable to arise where a judge who had partic ipated in the drafting or promotion of a piec e of legislation during the parliamentary proc ess was c alled upon to rule judic ially on the effec t of the legislation. 

56     When questioned why he and the late Abdillah Al Jufri, a witness to the will, c ould not have refrained from partaking in the deliberations of the Fatwa Committee whic h was to dec ide on the validity of the _nuzriah_ , the reply was that the five offic ial members of the Committee whic h inc luded Tuan Syed Isa as the c hairman and the late Abdillah Al Jufri were required by the AMLA to ac t unanimously. This is c learly wrong bec ause ss 32(4) and 32(5) of the AMLA spec ific ally provide for a mec hanism when there is no unanimity in the Fatwa Committee. Sec ondly, under s 31(6) of the AMLA, the c hairman ( _ie_ , the Mufti) and two other members of the Fatwa Committee, one of whom shall not be a member of Muis, shall form a quorum. Thirdly, under s 31(5) of the AMLA, the President of Singapore may appoint another person rec ommended by Muis to be the c hairman of the Fatwa Committee, in the absenc e of the Mufti. Given the flexibility, both Tuan Syed Isa and the late Abdillah c ould and should have exc used themselves from partaking in the said deliberations. It should be remarked at this stage that c ounsel for the defendant has quite c orrec tly c onc eded in his Submission (paras 78 and 79) that the plain reading of ss 32(4) and 31(6) of the AMLA do not quite support the explanation offered. 

**Critique on the expert for the plaintiffs** 

57     Counsel for the defendant, whilst extolling the standing and the qualific ations of Tuan Syed Isa, downplayed the expertise and experienc e of Dr Ismail. In my view, the c ritique is unjustified. The func tions of expert witnesses were suc c inc tly stated by Lord President Cooper in _Davie v Lord Provost, Magistrates and Councillors of the City of Edinburgh_ [1953] SC 34 at 40, when he said: 

 Their duty is to furnish the Judge or jury with the nec essary sc ientific c riteria for testing the ac c urac y of their c onc lusions, so as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the applic ation of these c riteria to the fac ts proved in evidenc e. 

58     It is a settled princ iple that when a c ase falls within the general rule requiring proof of foreign law (akin to the situation here where a sec ular c ourt is to delve into non-sec ular law) by an expert, the witness must be properly qualified (see _Cross & Tapper on Evidence_ (8th Ed, 1995) at p 784). Having reviewed the _curriculum vitae_ and the list of ac hievements of Dr Ismail, I have no hesitation in c onc luding that he is well qualified in Muslim law to give evidenc e before this c ourt. I found his 


testimony, whic h was supported by a substantial body of learning, and the manner in whic h he answered the questions put to him, to be c ommendable and worthy of respec t. 

59     It might be appropriate at this stage to deal with one other evidentiary aspec t. The plaintiffs initially obtained an opinion from one Haji Md Nor Haji Md Din (“Haji Md Nor”), who is desc ribed as a c ounsel in Islamic Law for the States of Malac c a, Negeri Sembilan and Johor, to support their c ase. The translation of Haji Md Nor’s opinion, from Malay to English, was in fac t introduc ed in evidenc e by the defendant himself. Not only that, Tuan Syed Isa himself had made referenc e to the said opinion in his affidavit of 9 April 2002. Nevertheless, at the c ommenc ement of the hearing, c ounsel for the defendant took objec tion to its admission on the basis that the dec larant was not available to give testimony and be c ross-examined. I found the objec tion valid. However, for the sake of c ompleteness and not otherwise, I ordered the said opinion to remain on rec ord sinc e the opinion had been referred to by the defendant’s expert Tuan Syed Isa in his opinion, with the proviso that c ounsel for the defendant c ould submit to the c ourt at the appropriate stage as to the weight to be given, if at all, to the said opinion. Surprisingly, however, when the hearing was reac hing its end, c ounsel for the defendant sought to introduc e in evidenc e a purported opinion (just about a page and a half in length) from the Mufti of Egypt touc hing upon the _nuzriah_ before this c ourt. Counsel for the plaintiffs objec ted to its admission in evidenc e, on the same grounds as those of the defendant raised earlier in relation to Haji Md Nor’s opinion. Having been informed that the maker of the doc ument would not be available to testify and be c ross-examined, I upheld the objec tion and ruled that the said doc ument was not to be admitted in evidenc e. In any event, the doc ument tendered is more in the form of a pronounc ement than an opinion and c ould not have assisted the c ourt muc h without oral testimony and c larific ation. 

**Division of the three segments – Fatwa Committee re-adjusting the share proportions** 

60     Besides the foregoing, the ruling issued by the Fatwa Committee does not also seem to reflec t the true intention of the testator as to the division of his estate. There are three segments in the will. The testator has direc ted that eac h segment is to rec eive one-third of his estate. The testator’s wish to give three equal portions to the three named segments was c onfirmed by Tuan Syed Isa. However, realising belatedly after exec ution and validation of the will that suc h equal division would be in violation of the princ iples of Muslim law, the Fatwa Committee deemed it fit to apportion the estate as to nine parts to the _nuzriah_ segment, six parts to the mosques and 12 parts to the legal heirs. For the purposes of c alc ulation, the Committee notionally fixed the value of the entire estate to c onsist of a total of 27 units. 

61     Tuan Syed Isa explained that after taking away the first one-third of the 27 notional units for _nuzriah_ (whic h ac c ording to him had been given away by the testator during his life), there remained 18 units for distribution in respec t of the testator’s bequest. After allotting one-third of the said 18 units ( _ie_ six units) to the mosques, the rest ( _ie_ 12 units) ac c rued to the legal heirs. 

62     The question is: If equal division, as desired and direc ted by the testator, would be c ontrary to Islamic law, did it not oc c ur to those who witnessed the will and who validated the will at the time of its exec ution that suc h a provision mandating equal distribution would not be in c onsonanc e with the princ iples of Muslim law? Why was suc h an advic e not proffered to the testator at that point in time and the _wasiat_ c orrec ted? The only reasonable inferenc e is that not muc h attention was paid to the wording of the will nor was the testator fully apprised of the true implic ations of Muslim law at the time when he exec uted the will, as opposed to the c laim that there is a general expec tation that Muis would make c orrec tions to the will, if it is found to c ontain errors or to be improper. 

63     In fac t, when asked why there was any need to c ertify and validate the will c ontaining the 

## [11] 


_nuzriah_ , as had been done in this c ase, Tuan Syed Isa erroneously relied on s 5(2)(d) of the AMLA whic h deals with the powers of Muis and has little to do with wills or _nuzriah_. Counsel for the defendant, whilst c onc eding this error on the part of Tuan Syed Isa, went on to explain that Tuan Syed Isa is not legally trained in c ivil law and is c alled to testify only on Muslim law. To say the least, I was somewhat perplexed by this submission, for the AMLA is an essential statutory adjunc t of Muslim law in Singapore. 

**Conclusion** 

64     Before c onc luding, I must say in all earnestness that I have the highest regard for Tuan Syed Isa. His sinc erity, zeal and dedic ation to the offic e he holds in the servic e of the Muslim c ommunity in Singapore are worthy of praise. Similarly, I also hold the members of the Fatwa Committee in high esteem. However, reviewing all the learning referred to and the arguments presented, I am of the view that inasmuc h as the property delineated for the purposes of the so-c alled _nuzriah_ would not leave the c ontrol, possession and ownership of the testator until after his demise, the said _nuzriah_ is no less than a bequest or testamentary disposition to c onvey an intended but invalid gift to the persons named (mostly legal heirs), and it plainly transgresses the restric tions imposed by Muslim law. The phraseology employed in the _nuzriah_ segment of the will dec laring that the property had already been given away to the proposed devisees three days or an hour before the death of the testator is a textual anac hronism and does not c onvert a myth or fic tion into reality, nor do the words referred to render the devise as that of a transac tion c ompleted during the testator’s life. Further, in my view, it is most likely that if the Fatwa Committee’s attention had been spec ific ally drawn to the c ase of _Re Fatimah_ or if the Committee had c arefully c onsidered the wider implic ations of the pec uliar wording of the said _nuzriah_ , it might well have paused and handed down a different advic e. 

65     After reviewing all the arguments and having asked myself the Hamlet questions, my c onc lusion is that the portion ear-marked as _nuzriah_ is void not only on ac c ount of its disc ordanc e with the princ iples of Muslim law relating to inheritanc e but also bec ause of the said segment’s inherent unc ertainty. Suc h unc ertainty does not, however, render the mosques and legal heirs segments invalid. It follows then – as is being suggested by c ounsel for the defendant in para 138 of his Submission – that one-third of the entire estate of the testator shall go to the two mosques named and the remainder be distributed to the legal heirs ac c ording to their entitlement as stated in the inheritanc e c ertific ate issued by the Syariah Court. All said, if the legal heirs wish to give effec t to the general wishes of the testator, as stated in the will, it is a matter for the legal heirs to dec ide by unanimous c onsent and in this, let prudenc e be their guide. 

66     In the premises, I grant an order in terms of prayers 1, 2 and 3 of the Amended Originating Summons. I shall hear parties on the question of c osts. 

_Order accordingly._
