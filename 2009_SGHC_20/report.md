**Introduction** 

1       This ac tion is yet another piec e of litigation between two sisters, Chan Gek Yong (“the plaintiff”) and Chan Gek Lan (“the defendant”). 

2       The plaintiff and the defendant are the registered tenants in c ommon in equal shares of a property at 46A Hillside Drive (“the Hillside property”). In this ac tion, the plaintiff seeks a dec laration that she is the legal and benefic ial owner of 65% of the Hillside property and for an order for the sale of that property and for 65% of the net proc eeds of sale to be paid to her. 

3       The defendant did not c ontest the intended sale but had initially made a c ounterc laim for a dec laration that the plaintiff and her held the Hillside property as trustees for three of their brothers with eac h of these three brothers having a one-third benefic ial interest. This c ounterc laim was withdrawn at trial leaving the plaintiff’s c laim to be entitled to 65% of the Hillside property as the main issue. An intermediate terrac e house stands on the Hillside property whic h has a land area of 175. sqm. 

4       The parents of the litigants are dec eased. The father had been running a tomb stone manufac turing business known as “Chan Guan Chua” and the mother had been running a provision shop known as “Chop Guan Huat”. 

5       There are eight c hildren in the family. The defendant is the eldest and the plaintiff is the sec ond eldest. The defendant attended Chung Hua Girls High Sc hool and her highest level of educ ation is Sec ondary Two. The plaintiff holds a diploma from the Singapore Polytec hnic. She worked as a teac her in a sec ondary sc hool, as a Parts Exec utive with the Inc hc ape Group, as a manager with Asia Motors Pte Ltd and then bec ame a partner in Chan Dental Clinic & Surgery whic h was essentially a prac tic e of one of their younger brothers, Chan Joo Hoc k. The business of the c linic was c arried out at Blk 253, Serangoon Central Drive, #01-233, Singapore 550253 (“the Serangoon property”) whic h was held by the plaintiff and the defendant as joint tenants. In Suit 287 of 2007, the plaintiff was making various c laims against the defendant, one of whic h was for the plaintiff’s share of rent paid by the c linic for the use of the Serangoon property. In that ac tion, the defendant in turn made a c ounterc laim for her share of the rent from the Serangoon property. I dismissed all the various c laims 


of the plaintiff and the c ounterc laim of the defendant in that ac tion. 

**Contentions and my conclusion** 

6       Coming bac k to the present ac tion, it was not disputed that in 1978, the father, Chan Tian Thye, intended to buy the Hillside property. However, he eventually dec ided that the Hillside property would be purc hased in the names of the plaintiff and the defendant. This property was transferred to them (by the vendor) as tenants in c ommon in equal shares. 

7       The plaintiff’s version of events was as follows. She alleged that that she had in the past banked in her salary into her bank ac c ount and then withdrew the same in c ash whic h she handed to her father. 

8       In or about 1978, the father had told her of his intention to buy the Hillside property for $118,000. He had informed her that he would use $50,000 of her money, whic h he had saved for her, to make a c ash payment of $58,000 with the remainder of $8,000 c oming from him. As for the balanc e of $60,000 (being $118,000 $50,000), this would be paid from a loan to be taken out by these two sisters on the sec urity of the Hillside property. The plaintiff asserted that she had paid 65% of the princ ipal sum and that therefore, the defendant held part of her half share on a resulting trust for the plaintiff. 

9       The defendant’s allegations were inc onsistent to some extent. For example, at paragraph 3 of her Defenc e and Counterc laim, the defendant alleged that the Hillside property had been paid for by their father. In paragraph 7 of the same pleading, she alleged that she had paid $46,200 being part of the purc hase pric e. In paragraph 8 of the same pleading, she alleged that the $46,200 (and another sum) were monies belonging to both the parties’ late parents. However, the defendant maintained that the plaintiff did not provide any of the funds to purc hase the Hillside property. 

10     The plaintiff said that it was not possible for their mother to have provided any money to make part or all of the c ash payment or the monthly payments to the financ e c ompany in respec t of the Hillside property bec ause the business of the provision shop was not doing well by 1978 although it had been making profits. The plaintiff also asserted that her salary was more than the dec lared inc ome of their mother or their father for the c alendar year 1976. Furthermore, the parents had subsequently paid for tertiary educ ation for two sons, inc luding educ ation in Canada for one, and all household expenses. They would not have been able to afford to do so if they had used their money to pay entirely for the Hillside property. 

11     I am of the view that the fac t that the plaintiff’s salary for 1976 was more than the dec lared inc ome of their mother or their father was neither here nor there. Obviously the parents had some financ ial means and that is why they c ould afford to pay for all the educ ation of the c hildren inc luding subsequent tertiary educ ation for two sons, inc luding an overseas educ ation, and all household expenses. The fac t that they c ould do that militated against the suggestion that they c ould not have afforded to pay entirely for the Hillside property. In any event, there was insuffic ient evidenc e to show ac c urately the state of their financ es as at the time when the Hillside property was bought. 

12     The defendant relied on various statements made by the plaintiff in two of her affidavits whic h she exec uted in Originating Summons No. 1677 of 2006 (before this ac tion was c onverted into the present Writ ac tion). I will refer to the Originating Summons as “OS 1677/06”. The defendant’s position was that although some of these statements mentioned that the plaintiff had paid part of the purc hase pric e, the plaintiff had ac knowledged that she had had only a half share in the Hillside property. The two affidavits whic h c ontained these statements were the plaintiff’s affidavit of 


31 August 2006 (“the plaintiff’s first affidavit”) and of 16 November 2006 (“the plaintiff’s third affidavit”). The statements the defendant relied on were: 

 (a) Paragraph 5 of the plaintiff’s first affidavit whic h stated that, “[we] are c o-owners in equal shares of two (2) properties, namely, Bloc k 253 Serangoon Central Drive #01Singapore 550253 ... and 46-A Hillside Drive Singapore 548991. ...” 

 (b) Paragraph 17 of the plaintiff’s first affidavit whic h stated that, “I wish to sell the Hillside property in the open market and after deduc ting all inc idental expenses and c osts, inc luding agents’ fees and legal c osts and outstanding property tax, the nett proceeds be divided equally between the Defendant and myself.” 

 (c ) Paragraph 8 of the plaintiff’s third affidavit whic h stated that, “... Our late father told me to invest my savings in the Hillside Property. He and I would pay equally and the property to be registered under the names of Chan Gek Lan and myself.” 

 (d) Paragraph 21 of the plaintiff’s third affidavit whic h stated that, “I disc ussed these matters with our late father and we agreed that I should invest as a half share interest in the Hillside property ...” 

 (e) Paragraph 22 of the plaintiff’s third affidavit whic h stated that, “Although I have half share of the Hillside Property, I did not have any objec tion to my family members using the property ...” 

 (f ) Paragraph 32 of the plaintiff’s third affidavit whic h stated that, “... Her half share of the property was paid for by our late father but my half share was paid out of my funds.” 

 (g) Paragraph 36 of the plaintiff’s third affidavit whic h stated that, “... I was not willing to exc hange my half share of the Hillside Property for Chan Gek Lan’s half share of the Serangoon Property bec ause prior to the Court order being made for equal share in the Serangoon Property, I was under the expec tation that I had 73% share in the Serangoon Property.” 

 [emphasis by the defendant] 

13     The plaintiff sought to explain why she made those statements. She said that she had only realised that her money had been used to pay for 65% of the purc hase pric e of the Hillside property, instead of 50%, after the Defendant had given disc overy of doc uments in the present Writ ac tion. Until then, she had all along thought that her money had been used to pay only 50% of the purc hase pric e. 

14     However, after OS 1677/06 was c onverted into a Writ ac tion, the plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim on 27 April 2007 to c laim a 65% share before disc overy had been given to her. She was not able to give a satisfac tory explanation as to why she was already able to c onc lude that she had paid for 65% of the purc hase pric e without the aid of doc uments from the defendant. In her c losing submissions, she asserted, at [183] thereof, that she had in fac t learned that she had c ontributed 65% of the purc hase pric e from the doc uments disc losed by the defendant in OS 1677/06. I am of the view that this was an attempt by the plaintiff to give evidenc e during the stage of c losing submissions and c annot be allowed. 

15     More importantly, I c ome now to the plaintiff’s explanation as to how she allegedly derived the figure of 65%. The purc hase pric e was $118,000. 65% thereof would be $76,700. 


16     The plaintiff said she paid $2,000 c ash to one Seet Sian Tiang (”Seet”) who was the original purc haser of the Hillside property as Seet had c hanged his mind and intended to buy another property at 46C Hillside Drive instead. The plaintiff said that after she had reimbursed Seet, the developer, Kau Nia Enterprise Pte Ltd issued a rec eipt in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant for the $2,000. However, the plaintiff was not able to explain why the developer issued a rec eipt to both of them when her payment was not made to the developer but to Seet. More importantly, the rec eipt did not disc lose who had provided the c ash of $2,000. 

17     Sec ondly, the plaintiff said her money was also used to pay the balanc e of 10% of the purc hase pric e, _ie_ , $9,800. She relied on a c opy of a c ashier’s order for $9,800 in favour of Seet whic h was to reimburse him for his payment of the same sum. However, again the c ashier’s order did not disc lose who had provided the $9,800. 

18     Thirdly, the plaintiff said that another $46,200 was paid by c heque from OCBC c urrent ac c ount number 511-XXXXXX-XXX (“the OCBC joint ac c ount”). This was a joint ac c ount held by the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that out of this $46,200, $38,200 was her money although there was no doc umentary evidenc e to establish this. I would add that the $38,200 plus the earlier two sums of $2,000 and $9,800 add up to $50,000. 

19     The plaintiff said that although their father had provided the c ash to make the three payments of $2,000, $9,800 and $46,200, he must have used her savings to pay the total of $50,000 for the reason stated below. She did not know where he had obtained the c ash from but he would hand the c ash either to the plaintiff or the defendant. Where a c ashier’s order or c heque was required, the rec ipient of the c ash would deposit the c ash into the OCBC joint ac c ount. Thereafter, someone would obtain a c ashier’s order or issue a c heque for the same amount. 

20     The plaintiff asserted that her money had been used to pay $50,000 bec ause she had agreed with their father to use $50,000 from her savings. 

21     The plaintiff also c ame up with some workings in Exhibit P1 to explain how she c onc luded that her money had been used to pay not just $50,000, but $76,700, being 65% of the purc hase pric e. 

22     She explained that her money had been used to make seven instalment payments to the financ e c ompany as follows (with referenc es to pages in the defendant’s bundle of doc uments):

23     The plaintiff said that when the instalment amount inc reased from $797 to $814, she had spoken to their father as he had told her to do so if there was a c hange in interest rate. When he learned from her about the inc rease in the instalment sum, he told her not to worry and that henc eforth, he would take c are of the monthly instalments. Prior to that, her money had been used. Based on the princ ipal sums paid from the above seven instalments, she would have paid another $4,137. towards the purc hase pric e. She said that monthly instalments were also paid from their father’s money for the period from May 1979 to say, November or Dec ember 1979, before the loan was redeemed in February 1980. 

24     The redemption amount was $49,498.03 (c omprising $49,450.40 + $47.63). The plaintiff deduc ted $4,137.69 from the redemption amount on the reasoning that $4,137 had been paid by her. This left a sum of $45,360.34. She then divided this sum by two, as she was supposed to pay half, whic h resulted in a sum of $22,680 and she rounded this down to $22,600. She then rounded down the figure of $4,137 (whic h she had previously deduc ted) to $4,100 and added this $4,100 to the $22, to derive a figure of $26,700. 

25     Then, she added the $26,700 to the sum of $50,000 previously disc ussed and derived the figure of $76,700, _ie_ , 65% of the purc hase pric e of $118,000. 

26     There was, however, no doc umentary evidenc e to establish that the money for the payment of the seven instalments she referred to c ame from her. Likewise, there was no doc umentary evidenc e that half the money for the redemption c ame from her. Her explanation as to why half of the redemption sum would have c ome from her money, even though their father had said that, henc eforth, he would take c are of the monthly instalments, was that she believed that she was paying half of the purc hase pric e. 

27     I do not find the plaintiff’s explanations c onvinc ing. 

28     First, I noted hesitanc y on her part before she explained that she was still paying half of the redemption sum even though their father had allegedly said he would henc eforth take c are of the monthly instalments. 

29     Sec ondly, it seems to me that she was trying to work out the figures to c ome up with an explanation to reac h a sum of $26,700 (before adding that sum to the $50,000). If she had paid the $4,137.69 from the seven instalments, there was no logic al reason for her to deduc t this sum from the redemption sum to c alc ulate what she had paid. The c orrec t approac h would be simply to add (without first making a deduc tion) the $4,137.69 to $22,600 being half of the redemption sum. It seems to me that she had deduc ted the $4,137.69 first and then added bac k a round figure of $4, 


bec ause she was trying to derive a figure of $26,700 to support her c laim. 

30     Thirdly and more signific antly, if the plaintiff was right that her money had been used to pay for more than 50% of the purc hase pric e, this would mean that their father had either misled her or had been c areless in appropriating more than he should have from her savings to pay the purc hase pric e. Yet, there was no suggestion that he had either misled her or had been c areless. 

31     The truth of the matter is that the c hildren did as their parents dic tated. If the plaintiff had passed her salary to their father, she was prepared to do so and let the father do with it as he wished. 

32     The dearth of evidenc e means that I c annot make a finding of fac t as to whether the money to fund the purc hase of the Hillside property c ame only from their father or both the parents (as the defendant c ontended) or from their father and the plaintiff (as the plaintiff c ontended). If the latter, I am also not able to c onc lude that 65% of the purc hase pric e was paid from the plaintiff’s savings. 

33     The burden of proof is on the plaintiff and she has failed to disc harge that burden. 

34     Even if she had provided the funds to pay 65% of the purc hase pric e, that would only raise a presumption of a resulting trust. On the evidenc e before me, I would have c onc luded that the presumption would have been rebutted in that she had agreed to the defendant having a legal and benefic ial half-share in the Hillside property irrespec tive of how muc h money she had provided, so long as that was the wish of the father, as I find to be the c ase. 

35     In the c irc umstanc es, I make the following orders: 

 (1) The plaintiff’s c laim for 65% of the Hillside property is dismissed. 

 (2) The Hillside property is to be sold in the open market within twelve (12) months from the date hereof by way of public auc tion or private treaty and upon “The Law Soc iety of Singapore Conditions of Sale 1999”. 

 (3) The sale pric e is to be agreed upon by the parties hereto within one month from the date of this order. In the absenc e of suc h an agreement within the time stipulated, the sale pric e is to be a pric e not below the prevailing market value as determined by a valuer to be appointed by the parties within two months from the date of this order. If the parties do not agree on the appointment of a valuer within the time stipulated, then the valuer is to be appointed by the c ourt after either party writes in for an appointment before the c ourt to appoint the valuer. 

 (4) The plaintiff and the defendant may have c onduc t of the sale. 

 (5) The defendant is to vac ate the Hillside property when the option to purc hase is exerc ised by the purc haser or if there is no option, when the sale and purc hase agreement is exec uted by the vendors and the purc haser. 

 (6) The defendant is to deliver the title deeds to her solic itors or the solic itor having c onduc t of the sale for safe-keeping and to c omplete any sale within one month from the date of this order. 

 (7) If any of the parties hereto c annot be found, is un-c ooperative or unwilling or fails, refuses or neglec ts to sign, seal and/or deliver any instrument, doc ument, deed, surrender of lease, 


 transfer or c onveyanc e required for the sale and transfer of the Hillside property within three days from a written request to do so by the other party or her solic itors, the Registrar of the Supreme Court may do so for and on behalf of the party in default. 

 (8) The net proc eeds of sale after deduc ting all inc idental expenses and c osts, inc luding housing agent’s fees, legal c osts for c onveyanc ing and all outstanding property tax, is to be shared equally between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

 (9) Parties shall have liberty to apply in respec t of the intended sale of the Hillside property. 

36     I will hear parties on c osts of the c laim and c ounterc laim.
