Choo Han Tec k J: 

**The claims** 

1       This is an ac tion by the plaintiff to rec over various moneys and property, whic h she c laimed to have been given by her to the defendant on trust. The plaintiff is a 74-year-old retiree and was at the material times a parishioner in the Churc h of St Theresa, where the defendant was, during those times, the parish priest. The plaintiff’s c laims may be referred to in the following terms for c onvenienc e. There are four items of c laim, namely: 

 (a) 394,000 shares in a Malaysian public c ompany c alled Guinness Anc hor Sdn Bhd (“the Guinness shares”). 

 (b) RM350,000 in c ash given to the defendant in Oc tober 1994. 

 (c ) $30,000 given to the defendant in May 2002. This money was given in three $10, notes and kept in a safe deposit box in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (“HSBC”) opened in the name of the defendant in May 2002 (“the safe deposit box”). 

 (d) $12,000 paid by the plaintiff to HSBC for unit trusts purc hased in the name of the defendant when she opened the safe deposit box. 

The plaintiff had also made various anc illary or alternative c laims in respec t of the Guinness shares, inc luding asking for an order that the defendant provide an ac c ount of the sale of any of the shares, and any dividends rec eived, and for an order for damages for wrongful c onversion. 

2       The plaintiff, a Catholic sinc e the 1960s, attended mass at the Churc h of St Theresa from 1991 bec ause her father’s ashes were interred in that c hurc h. She testified that she founded her trust in the defendant over the years mainly on the offic e the defendant held as a priest, but she did not know, until she read his amended Defenc e, that he had regarded himself as her “spiritual direc tor”, and “regular priest-c onfessor”. The defendant was the parish priest at the Churc h of St Theresa from 1989 to 2002. He was transferred to the Holy Trinity Churc h in 2002. However, the 


plaintiff c ontinued to attend mass at the Churc h of St Theresa with her usual regularity. 

3       The plaintiff testified that she was shoc ked to learn, on 1 April 2003, that the defendant was under investigation by the Commerc ial Affairs Department (“CAD”) for c riminal offenc es involving money donated to the c hurc h for its building fund. The plaintiff and her family had also donated to this fund. Eventually, the defendant was c harged and c onvic ted in the Distric t Court for various offenc es involving the breac h of trust of c hurc h money and was sentenc ed to imprisonment. The plaintiff’s c laims in this ac tion were not the subjec t of the c riminal proc eedings although she testified in the defendant’s c riminal trial and was c ross-examined in relation to these items c laimed. I digress here to make a quic k point whic h will bec ome c learer as the fac ts and issues of this c are unfold in this judgment, namely, that if the plaintiff’s evidenc e is ac c epted, then the defenc e of lac hes must fail. In other words, the plaintiff would not have sat on her rights and done nothing for an inordinately long time. 

**_The Guinness shares_** 

4       The plaintiff testified that she had the Guinness shares sinc e the 1960s, and her stoc k had been enlarged by purc hases made by her father for her, as well as through bonus and rights issues. In 1994, when she had dec ided to open a trading ac c ount in Kuala Lumpur, she had asked the defendant “whether he c ould hold some shares for [her] in his name”, and he had agreed. She explained that she did not know her broker in Kuala Lumpur well, and therefore, had preferred not to let him know that she had so many shares in Guinness Anc hor Sdn Bhd. She admitted that she c ould not remember the exac t words she had used when she handed the shares to the defendant, but she was “absolutely c ertain” that she had asked for his help, and he had agreed to help. The plaintiff testified that she only found out that the defendant had appropriated her Guinness shares to his own use when the CAD told her this in April 2003. The plaintiff did not then wish to “c omplic ate matters” for the defendant and had instruc ted her solic itors to withhold her c laims until after the defendant’s c riminal proc eedings had ended. 

5       The defendant’s version was that the shares were given to him as a personal gift bec ause he had agreed to ac t as the exec utor and trustee of the plaintiff’s will in 1994. These shares were worth about a million dollars by c ounsel’s rec koning. It is not known what the full worth of the plaintiff’s assets were at the time, but she had named the Catholic Churc h as the benefic iary of her house at Holland Road. In any event, the Guinness shares would form a large part of her assets. She had handed the two share c ertific ates c overing the 394,000 Guinness shares to him in the c ompound of the Churc h of St Theresa on the evening of 12 July 1994, after mass. He testified that she had told him that she had a gift for him, and had handed him a white envelope. She had told him that it c ontained some of her bonus shares in Guinness Anc hor Sdn Bhd whic h were worth about $1m. He stated that he “c ould hardly believe [his] ears as never in [his] life before had he rec eived suc h a large gift”. The plaintiff disputed this version. The defendant further elaborated that the plaintiff had written “92,000 bonus” on the envelope. He explained that it was not unusual in those days for c ompanies to give one-for-one shares and that he had got suc h bonus shares from other c ompanies suc h as Sime Darby, Shell, and Genting Berhad. The plaintiff’s c laim presently is for the return of 364,000 of the Guinness shares bec ause the defendant had sold 30,000 of the shares (for whic h the plaintiff c laims for an ac c ount to be taken). Ac c ording to the plaintiff, she did not know about the sale until sometime in 1995, after she had rec overed from surgery on her eye. She was peeved that the defendant had sold her shares without c onsulting her. However, she was somewhat mollified when he said that he had used the sale proc eeds in aid of c harity. She thought that it might appear rude then to ask that he return all the other shares. She felt that her displeasure had shown through suffic iently and that the defendant would be unlikely to sell any more of her shares without her permission. Indeed, he did not do so. 


**_The RM350,_** 

6       The plaintiff testified that sometime in 1994, she had wanted to transfer some of her Malaysian money to the defendant’s ac c ount in Malaysia so that he c ould use the money for her benefit in time of need. She had written him a c heque drawn on her Citibank ac c ount in Kuala Lumpur. She later learnt that the defendant had deposited this c heque into an ac c ount in Malayan Banking Bhd that he held jointly with one Chia Li Ling. It will be seen why the fac ts in the defendant’s c riminal c ase are relevant in this regard. There, the defendant had pleaded guilty to a c harge of misappropriation by transferring money from the parish c hurc h’s ac c ount into the joint ac c ount he held with Chia Li Ling. The defendant’s c ase in this ac tion before me was that the plaintiff had given him the money as a generous gift. The submission made on his behalf by his c ounsel, Mr Low, was entirely to show that there were no good reasons for the plaintiff to c reate a trust of this money. Furthermore, Mr Low questioned rhetoric ally why the plaintiff did nothing for years after knowing that the defendant had sold 30,000 of her shares. One answer c ould be that it was bec ause she had already given the shares to the defendant and he c ould do with them as he pleased. Another reason c ould be that she believed the defendant when he told her that he had sold the 30,000 shares to raise funds for c harity. The questions raised by c ounsel were, independently, reasonably sound; but if the plaintiff’s ac c ount were true, that would be a suffic ient answer to Mr Low’s question. 

**_The $30,000 in $10,000 notes_** 

7       The plaintiff had rented the safe deposit box on 14 May 2002 at HSBC in the name of the defendant and had deposited three $10,000 notes into the box. She said that this arose from a c hain of events. She had drawn up a will in whic h the defendant had been named as the sole exec utor and trustee. When he told her that his papers in his c hurc h offic e were ac c essible to third parties, the plaintiff had bec ome c onc erned that her will might not be kept in the privac y that she wanted. Henc e she had opened the safe deposit box for the defendant to keep her will. She had also given him the three notes of $10,000 eac h to be used for her in c ase of urgent need. At that time, she also appointed the defendant as the alternate ac c ount holder of her own safe deposit box. She explained in c ourt that although he was the alternate ac c ount holder, there was only one key and she kept it. Thus, she wanted to leave some ready c ash in her exec utor’s safe deposit box for his c onvenienc e. The defendant c laimed that the $30,000 deposited into the safe deposit box was a present by the plaintiff to him. His c ase was that the plaintiff had already made him the joint ac c ount holder to her own safe deposit box, and henc e, he had ac c ess to anything kept there so that there was no need to make provision for an emergenc y, so to speak. The plaintiff’s answer to this was that although the defendant was a joint ac c ount holder, she held the only key to that safe deposit box. The defendant did not c hallenge this evidenc e, but that might only mean that his ac c ess to the box would be more diffic ult – not that it would be impossible. 

**_The $12,000 deposit_** 

8       The plaintiff testified that HSBC was only willing to let her open the safe deposit box (whic h was opened in the defendant’s name) if she plac ed a $12,000 deposit with the bank as an investment. The defendant disputed that, and c laimed that the safe deposit box was opened by the plaintiff and maintained by her solely for his personal benefit, to do as he pleased, bec ause she was sorry for him that he did not have one. He c laimed that the $12,000 deposit was intended by the plaintiff to be a gift to him. 

**Evaluation of the evidence** 

9       The c ompeting versions of the plaintiff and defendant, on eac h of the c laims, are reasonably 


c redible. For example, in the one, it is possible that the plaintiff had given the shares and money to the defendant, at the time when their relationship was at its strongest, intending them to be given as personal gifts to the defendant. The plaintiff was a wealthy person who had donated millions of dollars to the c hurc h and other c harities. She testified that she had given $10,000 to one Sister Lau, whom she did not know then, when Sister Lau made a personal appeal to her for financ ial aid towards her studies abroad. The plaintiff testified that when Sister Lau was in c harge of the De LaSalle Sc hool, she had made an appeal for funds for the sc hool and the plaintiff had responded by donating $50,000. Subsequently, when Sister Lau bec ame the princ ipal of Catholic Junior College and appealed to her financ ially, the plaintiff had given a $10,000 c ontribution in the form of a $10,000 note that was handed to the defendant to be given to Sister Lau. The defendant had kept the note and written a c heque for $10,000 from the Churc h’s ac c ount. The defendant, on the other hand, c laimed in this trial that the plaintiff had given him money in the form of $10,000 notes previously, and c ited this oc c asion as an example. The defendant admitted that Sister Lau had written a rec eipt made out to the Churc h and handed it to him, but he had not handed it over to the plaintiff. Thus, the plaintiff’s c ounsel, Mr Mic hael Khoo SC, suggested to the defendant that the rec eipt would have put the plaintiff on inquiry as to why Sister Lau had made out the rec eipt to the parish c hurc h, and not to her. The defendant’s version (that he had given the $10,000 note to Sister Lau) was, therefore, not supported by this fac t. 

10     It may not be unreasonable for a person of suc h a generous disposition as the plaintiff to lavish her generosity in the way the defendant alleged, that is, on her priest who was also her c onfidant and friend (if that were the c ase). On the other hand, it is also possible that she had intended to keep some c ash and stoc k in the c are of her trusted priest, and friend, to her use in a time of need. The plaintiff is now 74 years old. At the time she handed the Guinness shares to the defendant in 1994, she was 63. Although she had siblings who were also wealthy, she was the main person looking after her mother and keeping her c ompany. In 1994, her own health was threatened by a mysterious growth in her left eye that required surgery, and c onsequently, she made arrangements in respec t of her financ ial assets in c ase she were to bec ome inc apac itated after her surgery. Her reasons for handing over the shares to the defendant, helping him open and maintain a safe deposit box, and depositing large sums of money with him for safe keeping would seem reasonable enough in the c irc umstanc es. The defendant’s version in respec t of the opening of the safe deposit box and the advanc e of the $12,000 nec essary to open it, if true, would show, in a sense, the generosity of the plaintiff to the defendant to the extreme. But, if she was happy to give him the Guinness shares, then $12,000 pales immediately in c omparison. The issues are thus not as straightforward or unc onnec ted as one might think. 

11     This c ourt has to dec ide whic h of the two possibilities, eac h reasonable in itself, is the more probable. The c ore of the two c ompeting versions of the story, that is, whether the money and shares were handed over as gifts or given upon trust, emanated from only two witnesses – the plaintiff and the defendant. There was no independent c orroboration of either story. There were no other witnesses to bear testimony to either ac c ount. Apart from the testimony of the two protagonists, I am left with only the peripheral and bac kground fac ts from whic h c ounsel urged me to draw various inferenc es – inferenc es that would inc line me to one result or the other. Some of these fac ts are undisputed and inc ontrovertible – suc h as the fac t that the defendant had pleaded guilty to various c riminal c harges involving the misappropriation of money belonging to the Ch u rc h of St Theresa. But even so, some aspec ts of these fac ts remain open to question, for example, the reasons as to why the defendant dec ided to plead guilty midway through the c riminal trial. The defendant averred that he had personal reasons, not least prompted by eminent members in the high ec helons of the Catholic Churc h, to do so. Mr Khoo, however, suggested that no suc h thing oc c urred, and the c onc lusion he urged me to form, from his c ross-examination of the defendant, was that (to put it bluntly) the defendant had pleaded guilty bec ause he was in fac t guilty. But what does that 


guilt mean in this c ase before me? 

12     Sec tion 54 of the Evidenc e Ac t, (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides that: 

 In c ivil c ases the fac t that the c harac ter of any person c onc erned is suc h as to render probable or improbable any c onduc t imputed to him is irrelevant, exc ept in so far as suc h c harac ter appears from fac ts otherwise relevant. 

I would be putting myself in danger of oversimplifying s 54 were I to paraphrase this sec tion, as saying that “c harac ter” in a c ivil trial is irrelevant unless the fac ts show that it is relevant. There is a long route through whic h the origin and permutations of the stiffly-worded language of this legislative provision have slowly meandered until it c an be read in that short form that I have set out above. But I think that it is not nec essary for me, for the purposes of this c ase, to provide a lengthy exc ulpation of my reading of s 54. In his c ross-examination of the defendant, Mr Khoo relentlessly reminded him of evidenc e from the c riminal trial relating to his misappropriation of c hurc h funds. It was evident from the c ross-examination what Mr Khoo had hoped to emphasise. He made that emphasis c lear by his c hoic e of words that the defendant was “surreptitiously siphoning out $5.1 million” from c hurc h funds towards his personal use in the purc hase of c ondominium flats in Penang and Singapore, and not, as the defendant asserted, something he did “in ac c ordanc e with c anon law”. The question, thus, is whether these are the kinds of fac ts that would make the defendant’s c harac ter relevant within the meaning of s 54. I do not think so in this c ase. The key issue here is whether the property and money were gifts or not. 

13     Nonetheless, I am of the view that there is one aspec t c onc erning the defendant’s handling of the c hurc h funds that is a matter of interest to this c ourt, although I am not required here to judge whether, and if so why, the moral c ompass of this priest bec ame maladjusted. Those are not relevant questions for this c ourt even if they do remain viable, or of interest, so far as the defendant’s c hurc h and his parishioners are c onc erned. The relevant c onnec tion between the defendant’s c onduc t in the c riminal proc eedings and the present ac tion is this. The matters relating to the c riminal c ase, inc luding the ac ts for whic h he was c harged, his plea of guilt, as well as his present testimony about them, suc h as his “reasons for pleading guilty”, set out at some length in his evidenc e-in-c hief, are relevant in determining whether the defendant’s understanding of the meaning of fiduc iary duty, and the doc trines of trust, was c onventional or not. That has a direc t bearing in this c ase bec ause the defendant denied that he was holding the money and assets in trust for the plaintiff. The issue, henc e, is whether he had a reasonable or c orrec t understanding of that term and c onc ept. It goes towards c redibility. The fac ts established in the previous c riminal proc eedings are also relevant in establishing the manner in whic h the defendant was ac c ustomed in dealing with money that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping. But to regard these as relevant for c onsideration does not nec essarily lend assistanc e to the exerc ise of determining how muc h weight ought to be attac hed to them – that is another exerc ise. 

14     In response, the defendant testified that he did no wrong in respec t of the matters in the c riminal proc eedings bec ause he had ac ted in ac c ordanc e with c anon law. Mr Low produc ed exc erpts from two c ommentaries on c anon law to support the defendant’s justific ation of his c onduc t there. One was entitled _The Canon Law – Letter & Spirit_ , published by the Canon Law Soc iety of Great Britain and Ireland. The sec ond was _New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law_ , a public ation of the Canon Law Soc iety of Americ a. The defendant testified that the parish c hurc h did not have a legal status to hold property in its own name, and sinc e he was the parish priest of the Churc h of St Theresa, he was bound to invest exc ess c hurc h funds. But he c ould only do so by making the investments in his name. He testified that his interpretation of the relevant c anon law justified his c onduc t, and whic h would have absolved him from any ec c lesiastic al as well as sec ular misc onduc t. 


Before proc eeding further, I should address Mr Khoo’s objec tion to the referenc e to c anon law. He submitted that c anon law should only be admitted through expert witnesses. In so far as c anon law is not the applic able law in our c ourts, it must be regarded just like a foreign law, admissible upon proof by experts. However, in the present c ase, the parties have not put these laws in issue in the sense that I am required to make a finding as to what princ iple or rule in c anon law applied in the present c ase. On the c ontrary, neither c ounsel wished to quarrel over the forc e and effec t of that law. Thus, the only relevanc e of the referenc e to c anon law was to show that the defendant had relied on some of those princ iples in order to maintain his stand that he had done no wrong in respec t of the matters in whic h he had been c onvic ted. Whether he was right to do so (that is, to rely on those princ iples) is a separate matter, and one that is not in issue before me. However, the defendant fac ed a sec ond problem. He had pleaded guilty and admitted to the Statement of Fac ts, whic h referred to the c onduc t that he now renounc ed. He therefore tried to explain to me why he had pleaded guilty. The c lear impression he made in his evidenc e-in-c hief was that he did so bec ause various parties, inc luding the loc al c hurc h authority, c oerc ed him into it. Unless the plea and admissions are set aside, the defendant is bound by them. 

15     Mr Khoo submitted that many instanc es of Mr Low’s submissions were in breac h of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 in that those aspec ts were not put to the plaintiff in c ross-examination. I have c onsidered those passages in Mr Low’s submissions that Mr Khoo referred me to, and am of the view that I should not disregard them. I would prefer to c onsider them together with the entirety of the evidenc e. _Browne v Dunn_ is a very old c ase, dec ided during a time when the evidenc e of the opposing parties was not disc losed to eac h other. The exc hange of affidavits of evidenc e-in-c hief in the modern c ivil trial ameliorates the misc hief desc ribed by Lord Hersc hell LC in _Browne v Dunn_ , at 70. That c ase may still be relevant where a litigant wishes to rely on a hitherto undisc losed fac t that is c ruc ial and might on its own swing the favour of the c ourt one way or the other. The matters raised by Mr Khoo do not, in my view, fall into this c ategory. By way of example, Mr Khoo objec ted to Mr Low’s submission that the plaintiff ought to have handed Singapore or Australian c urrenc ies instead of Malaysian shares to the defendant if she really wanted to have ready funds. I take this as a submission as to what inferenc e I ought to draw. I think that Mr Low was entitled to make that submission. As it was, Mr Khoo had a ready reply to the inferenc e that Mr Low had in mind. So I had taken the opposing arguments into c onsideration. 

16     Throughout the trial, many questions were raised about the motives and the intentions of the plaintiff as well as the defendant. Some of the questions have been explic itly answered, though many of the answers given by the two litigants were diametric ally opposed. Why would a person in the plaintiff’s c irc umstanc es wish to give a million dollars to a priest? Conversely, one might also ask: What did the plaintiff hope to ac hieve by asking the defendant to hold her money and property in trust for her? The plaintiff said that she thought that her money would be safe in the hands of a priest, espec ially one whom she had c ome to know and like. Intentions and motives of this nature c annot be asc ertained by logic alone. On the c ontrary, some transac tions between friends, as well as people who believe they know eac h other well, are like leaps of faith; they c an be notoriously illogic al. We c an detec t an inc onsistent line when we ask why someone in the defendant’s situation and c irc umstanc es would resist the plaintiff’s c laim. The defendant’s c ounsel opened his c ase by reading a passage from the Bible found in c h 10 of the Gospel of Matthew to the plaintiff – in that passage, the Christ of their c ommon faith had exhorted the ric h to forsake all their worldly goods, saying that it is easier for the c amel to go through the eye of the needle than for the ric h man to go to heaven. It was read by c ounsel for the purpose of emphasising the gift of generosity inherent in the plaintiff’s nature. To that extent, that emphasis was relevant bec ause the plaintiff was indeed a generous person, and part of my duty in this c ase, is to determine the extent of that generosity. I find it diffic ult, however, to understand the above passage from the Bible fully, without seeing how it exempts the defendant himself. Ought not the same prec ept to apply to the one who ministers as it 


does the person ministered to? There may be a good, perhaps philanthropic , reason why the defendant fought so tenac iously to keep the wealth in question; but he had not told this c ourt what that might be. So, with generosity and avaric e, so inextric ably intertwined in this c ase, enc asing the plaintiff and defendant alike, the true motive and intention of the parties – and here I am referring to the full, undisguised state of mind – is not c learly disc ernible; yet that is the heart of this c ase, and finding that intention is what this c ourt has to do. There are no fixed rules as to how this might be done, but one must not be too quic k to ill-judge a person’s intention, or to dismiss a possibility on the basis that a right-thinking person would have intended otherwise, without making allowanc e for the possibility that even the most sure-footed may slip and stumble from time to time. 

17     For example, in respec t of one of the fac tual issues in this c ase, it will be seen that there c ould be two possible reasons why the plaintiff’s list of assets in her will did not inc lude the Guinness shares. One possibility is that she had already given those shares away to the defendant. The other is that she had only listed those assets that were within her own possession, exc luding those held in trust. What did the plaintiff have in mind when she wrote out that list? She said that it was only to let her exec utor know what assets she had with her. Sinc e the defendant was to be her exec utor, he did not need to be reminded that he held some of her assets. Sinc e the inferenc es to be drawn from the inc ontrovertible fac ts of the transfer of property and money c an reasonably be in favour of either party, and there being no c orroboration of the litigants by independent witnesses, on the balanc e, I am more inc lined to ac c ept the unc orroborated evidenc e of the plaintiff than that of the defendant. Muc h of what the defendant asserted in his evidenc e might possibly be true, but many established fac ts are against him. He had testified that he was holding money jointly with Chia Li Ling in trust for the parish c hurc h bec ause the parish c hurc h c ould not make investments on its own. Chia Li Ling was not c alled to explain her role in those episodes. Her evidenc e would be relevant bec ause it would have c orroborated, and perhaps c larified that of the defendant’s own evidenc e, and to help me understand the defendant’s perc eption of trust property and gifts. That omission, taken together with the absenc e of support from the Catholic Churc h in respec t of his idea of trust property, left me with only his word. Thus, fac ed with the simple, but c ruc ial, question, “Do I believe the plaintiff or the defendant?”, I find myself reluc tant to ac c ept the defendant’s evidenc e without c orroboration. Between the two unc orroborated testimonies, I would inc line towards that of the plaintiff’s. I c ome to this c onc lusion without giving any piec e of evidenc e spec ial signific anc e, or giving any spec ific evidenc e more weight than another, whic h is often possible, but not in this c ase. 

18     For the reasons above, I find that the balanc e of probabilities lies in the plaintiff’s favour, and I, therefore, allow the plaintiff’s c laim in full. Costs are to follow the event, and be taxed if not agreed.
