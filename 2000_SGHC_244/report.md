: This was an appeal against the dec ision of distric t judge S Thyagarajan, who ac quitted Kuah Kok Choon (`Kuah`) of a c harge under s 4(2) of the Endangered Spec ies (Import and Export) Ac t (Cap 92A) (`the Ac t`) for possession of two Lear`s Mac aws without a requisite permit. Despite the ac quittal, the distric t judge ordered the two Lear`s Mac aws to be forfeited under s 13(2)(b) of the Ac t. The prosec ution appealed against Kuah`s ac quittal while Kuah appealed against the order of forfeiture. I allowed the prosec ution`s appeal against Kuah`s ac quittal and dismissed Kuah`s appeal against the forfeiture of the two birds. I now give my reasons. 

**_The facts_** 

On 18 July 1996, one Dr Leong Hon Keong of the Primary Produc tion Department (`PPD`) spotted the two Lear`s Mac aws in a large c age by the window on the first floor of 99 Rangoon Road. 

On 20 July 1996 at about 9.30am, the PPD c onduc ted a surprise inspec tion at 99 Rangoon Road. When their offic ers arrived at the premises, the two Lear`s Mac aws were in the same position as when they were spotted two days earlier by Dr Leong. Kuah was not home but his father, Kuah Thian Swee, was. He c ame out to speak to the offic ers. At about the same time, the offic ers observed the c age housing the Lear`s Mac aws on the first floor being moved and brought away from the window into the building. 

The offic ers wanted to c onduc t the inspec tion immediately but Kuah`s father asked that they wait until he had spoken to Kuah. He c ontac ted Kuah by telephone. Dr Leong also spoke to Kuah and was asked to wait until Kuah c ontac ted his lawyer. The offic ers waited for about half an hour. 

At about 10am, an offic er who was stationed by the road informed Dr Leong that the birds were no longer visible from the road. The offic ers then insisted on inspec ting the first floor immediately. They found that the birds were no longer in the c age. The offic ers searc hed the premises and found the two Lear`s Mac aws in a room on the first floor. One of them was hidden in a green sports bag with brown trimmings while the other was in a pink and white c loth bag. Both birds were seized. 

**_The charge_** 


The c harge brought against Kuah read as follows: 

 You, Kuah Kok Choon, male / 24 years old NRIC No S7410016-C are charged that you, on 20 July 1996, at about 9.30am at 99 Rangoon Road, Singapore, did have in your possession two Lears Macaws (Anodorhynchus Leari), a scheduled species under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (Cap 92A), which were imported without a permit issued by the Director of Primary Production, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 4(2) and punishable under s 4(3) of the said Act. 

**_Decision of the trial judge_** 

At the trial below, the following points were not disputed: (a) that Kuah was in possession of the two Lear`s Mac aws; (b) that Lear`s Mac aws are a sc heduled spec ies under the Ac t; (c ) that Lear`s Mac aws are not indigenous to Singapore and it was highly unlikely that the two in question were bred in Singapore; and (d) that no permit has ever been issued under the Ac t for the import of Lear`s Mac aws into Singapore. 

The defenc e`s c ase was simply that Kuah bought the Lear`s Mac aws before the Ac t c ame into forc e. This meant that they c ould not have been imported in c ontravention of the Ac t and therefore that the elements of the c harge had not been proven by the prosec ution. 

Both the distric t judge and the prosec ution in the c ourt below ac c epted this defenc e as legitimate. For want of other supporting evidenc e, the prosec ution sought to prove that the Lear`s Mac aws were imported into Singapore after 17 Marc h 1989, the date the Ac t c ame into forc e, by adduc ing evidenc e to establish the age of the birds. If the birds were younger than eight years of age in 1998 when they were examined, then the inferenc e would be that they were imported after the Ac t c ame into forc e in 1989. 

Therefore, the main issue in the trial revolved around establishing the age of the two Lear`s Mac aws. Both sides c alled upon experts to advanc e arguments on their behalf. The expert who testified for the prosec ution was one Carlos Yamashita. He is a field biologist who has done extensive researc h on Lear`s Mac aws. He examined the two Lear`s Mac aws in question and estimated that they were less than five years of age. He reac hed this c onc lusion based purely on the method of external morphology. The expert witness for the defenc e was one Dr Gerry M Dorrestein. Although not an expert on Lear`s Mac aws, he is well versed in avian matters, as evidenc ed by his extensive c urric ulum vitae. The purpose for whic h he was c alled as a witness was to dispute the methodology used by Mr Yamashita to age the birds. The c rux of his testimony was that it was not sc ientific ally proven that the age of a Lear`s Mac aw c ould be ac c urately determined by external morphology. 

The distric t judge upheld the defenc e`s main objec tion raised to the prosec ution`s expert testimony, that is, over Mr Yamashita`s methodology. The evidenc e showed that there is no sc ientific method of using external morphology to determine a Lear`s Mac aws age and thus his c onc lusions were c onsidered to be unreliable. Sinc e the prosec ution had not adduc ed other suffic iently strong evidenc e as to how, when or by whom the two Lear`s Mac aws were allegedly illegally imported into Singapore, Kuah was ac quitted of the c harge. 

After the ac quittal, the prosec ution asked the c ourt to nonetheless order the forfeiture of the two 


Lear`s Mac aws. The distric t judge exerc ised his disc retion to do so and ordered that the two Lear`s Mac aws be forfeited to the Direc tor-General, Agri-food and Veterinary servic es pursuant to s 13(2)(b) of the Ac t. 

**_The Act_** 

At this point, it would be c onvenient to set out the relevant provisions of the Ac t. Sec tion 4 reads as follows: 

 (1) No person shall import, export, re-export or introduce from the sea any scheduled species without a permit. 

 (2) No person shall have in his possession, under his control, sell, offer or expose for sale, or display to the public any scheduled species which has been imported or introduced from the sea in contravention of subsection (1). 

 (3) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both. 

**_The appeal against acquittal_** 

Having perused s 4(2) of the Ac t, it was c lear to me that, for the c harge to be made out in this c ase, the prosec ution needed to prove three elements, namely (i) possession; (ii) the two Lear`s Mac aws in possession were a sc heduled spec ies; and (iii) they must have been imported in c ontravention of subsec tion (1). 

It was not disputed by either side that Lear`s Mac aws are a sc heduled spec ies under the Ac t and that the two in question were in Kuah`s possession. It was the third element that c aused great c onfusion both at the trial below and at the appeal. The defenc e alleged that the third element had not been made out bec ause the prosec ution c ould not prove that the two Lear`s Mac aws had been imported **_after_** the Ac t c ame into forc e and thus c ould not show that the import was in c ontravention of sub-s (1). 

Sec tion 4(1) of the Ac t states that `(n)o person shall import, export, re-export or introduc e from the sea any sc heduled spec ies **_without a permit_** .` The c orrec t way to c onstrue the third element of s 4(2) is simply to substitute the language of sub-s (1) into sub-s (2). When this is done, s 4(2) will read: (n)o person shall have in his possession, ... any sc heduled spec ies whic h has been imported ... without a permit.` 

When c onstrued in this way, it bec omes c lear that all the elements of the c harge, inc luding the third element, were made out in this c ase, as they were undisputed by the defenc e in the first plac e. The defenc e never disputed that no permit had been issued for the import of the two Lear`s Mac aws sinc e the PPD had never issued a permit under the Ac t for the import of Lear`s Mac aws into Singapore. 


The prosec ution c ommitted a grave error by c onc eding at the trial below that it had the burden to prove that the Lear`s Mac aws were imported after the Ac t c ame into forc e. A plain reading of the relevant provisions of the Ac t shows that for the c harge under s 4(2) to be made out, there is never a requirement for the prosec ution to show **_when_** the birds were imported. To impute suc h a burden on the prosec ution would be to impose requirements that were plainly not stated in the legislation. The trial judge was c learly misled by this c onc ession of the prosec ution, whic h led to his misinterpretation of the law. 

I must emphasise that the c harge here pertained to possession rather than to import. As long as possession of a sc heduled spec ies, on a date after the Ac t c ame into effec t, is proved, the offenc e is made out if there has been no requisite import permit. The date of possession must be after the Ac t has c ome into forc e, but the date of import is irrelevant for a c harge under s 4(2). Where any person c hooses to possess, have under his c ontrol, sell, offer or expose for sale, or display to the public any sc heduled spec ies, the onus is on that person to c hec k and ensure that proper import permits have been obtained for the partic ular sc heduled spec ies. If import permits have not been obtained, then the onus is again on that person to seek an exemption from the Direc tor-General under s 18 of the Ac t. 

Returning to the fac ts of the c ase, it was not disputed that Kuah possessed the two Lear`s Mac aws, whic h are a sc heduled spec ies under the Ac t, and that no import permit had been granted for these two birds. This being the c ase, the c harge was already made out and the roundabout route that the prosec ution c hose to prove their c ase was utterly unnec essary. The great emphasis on expert evidenc e, to prove the age of the birds, during the lengthy trial was totally irrelevant sinc e the c harge had already been proven. 

Onc e the c harge is made out, the burden then shifts on to the defenc e to either dispute possession or that the animal in possession was not a sc heduled spec ies, or to argue that import permits were issued or that an exemption applied. None of these elements were made out by the defenc e in this c ase. Indeed, the defenc e c onc eded that the three elements of the offenc e were present. 

Therefore, sinc e the c harge was made out and no defenc e was raised to disprove any element of the offenc e, I ac c ordingly allowed the prosec ution`s appeal against ac quittal and c onvic ted Kuah of the offenc e as c harged. 

**_The appeal against forfeiture_** 

The provisions in the Ac t whic h provide for forfeiture are found in s 13, the relevant portions of whic h read as follows: 

 (1) Upon the conviction of any person for an offence under s 4 or 4A, the scheduled species in respect of which the offence was committed and any other thing seized under s 9(4)(b), (c) or (d) shall, without further order, be forfeited to the Director-General. 

 (2) Where a person who is prosecuted for an offence under s 4 or 4A is acquitted or given a discharge, conditional or otherwise, the court may order the scheduled species in respect of which the prosecution was brought and any other thing seized under s 9(4)(b), (c) or (d) 


 (a) to be released to the person from whom they were seized or to the owner thereof; or 

 (b) to be forfeited to the Director-General. 

Having ac quitted Kuah, the distric t judge then exerc ised his disc retion and ordered the two Lear`s Mac aws to be forfeited to the Direc tor-General under s 13(2)(b). However, sinc e I allowed the prosec ution`s appeal and c onvic ted Kuah, forfeiture of the two Lear`s Mac aws to the Direc torGeneral was no longer disc retionary bec ause it bec ame automatic by virtue of s 13(1). As suc h, I dismissed Kuah`s appeal against the forfeiture of the two Lear`s Mac aws. 

**_The appropriate sentence_** 

I next proc eeded to c onsider the appropriate sentenc e to impose on Kuah. The relevant sentenc ing provision is found in s 4(3) of the Ac t, whic h provides that on c onvic tion, the ac c used may be sentenc ed to a fine not exc eeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding one year or to both and, in the c ase of a sec ond or subsequent c onvic tion, to a fine not exc eeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exc eeding one year or to both. 

The prosec ution submitted that Kuah had several antec edents and this was c ertainly not his first offenc e. In 1994, he was c onvic ted in Perth, Western Australia for an unauthorised import of six exotic parrots into Australia. In November 1995, he was fined for attempting to smuggle three birds and one squirrel into Singapore in c ontravention of s 9(2) of the Wild Animals and Birds Ac t (Cap 351). In 1996, Kuah was c aught by a c ustoms offic er in Paris, en route from Brazil to Singapore, transporting two Lear`s Mac aws in a duffel bag without any import or export doc uments. He was subsequently c harged and c onvic ted of an offenc e under the Penal Code (Cap 224) in 1999 for obtaining from Singapore, and using as genuine, a forged PPD import permit to obtain the release of two Lear`s Mac aws whic h had been seized by the Frenc h c ustoms. Finally, Kuah had previously pleaded guilty in 1997 to three c harges relating to the possession of illegally ac quired gibbons, whic h were seized from his premises in a raid in July 1996. 

With suc h a long list of antec edents, the prosec ution urged the c ourt to impose a deterrent sentenc e. It submitted that suc h a sentenc e would also serve to deter like-minded people from c ommitting similar c rimes. 

On the other hand, c ounsel for Kuah urged me to c onsider that Kuah was only 22 years of age at the date of the offenc e in 1996. He argued that Kuah`s c onvic tion in relation to the possession of gibbons was part of the same transac tion as this present offenc e, as the gibbons were seized at around the same time as the two Lear`s Mac aws. He further submitted that Kuah`s offenc es were all c ommitted in the period of 1995-1996, when he was just a young boy who had gone overboard. Finally, he submitted that the forfeiture of the birds was already a penalty and therefore his c lient should not be punished any further. 

The offenc e c ommitted in the present instanc e is not a minor one. The two Lear`s Mac aws are undoubtedly valuable and worth a lot. This is bec ause Lear`s Mac aws are extremely endangered, with a population of only 130 in the wild in Brazil and on the brink of extinc tion. They are indigenous only to Brazil. I had no doubt that Kuah was aware of the need to preserve these spec ies. He was obviously not an amateur bird c ollec tor who happened to c hanc e upon the two Lear`s Mac aws at a 


bird shop and bought them, being unaware that they were extremely endangered. On the c ontrary, he had an extensive knowledge of birds, having had papers published in international journals c onc erning avic ulture and ornithology, and having set up his own breeding farm. In addition, he had 600 to 800 birds at his residenc e in July 1996 at the time of the raid. However, a perusal of his antec edents made me think that he was more c onc erned with the trading of birds than with their welfare. He had attempted to smuggle various animals through various c ountries, with no regard for the preservation and protec tion of these animals. 

In Singapore, the Ac t was enac ted to give effec t to the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Spec ies of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), whic h Singapore has ratified. The main purpose of CITES is to protec t c ertain spec ies of wild fauna and flora against over-exploitation through international trade. I was of the opinion that a deterrent sentenc e had to be imposed to reflec t how seriously Singapore regards its obligations under CITES. Singapore has c ommitted itself to c o-operating with other c ountries to preserve their endangered spec ies and Kuah`s ac tions went against the spirit of this c o-operation. 

Therefore, I felt that youth was no exc use for Kuah`s c ontravention of the Ac t. He was c learly c ognisant of his ac tions and c ommitted c rimes of a similar nature repeatedly without any semblanc e of repentanc e. His antec edents and his experienc e with birds left me in no doubt that he was knowingly in possession of the two Lear`s Mac aws without the requisite import permits. I was of the opinion that a fine would be grossly inadequate in the c irc umstanc es. The maximum fine would hardly have any punitive effec t whatsoever sinc e one Lear`s Mac aw alone c ould be worth more than $10,000. Therefore, to underline the seriousness of the offenc e, I imposed the maximum sentenc e of one year`s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000, with six months` imprisonment in default thereof. 

## Outcome: 

Appeal against ac quittal allowed; appeal against forfeiture dismissed.
