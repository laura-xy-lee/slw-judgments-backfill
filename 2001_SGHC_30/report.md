: The plaintiff, Madam Vasuhi d/o Ramasamypillai, whose husband died of a heart attac k, sued the defendants (hereinafter referred to as `TTSH`) for negligenc e in the treatment of her husband`s heart c ondition. TTSH denied any negligenc e on the part of their doc tors and maintained that they provided the dec eased with proper treatment for his c ondition. 

**_Background_** 

Madam Vasuhi`s husband, Karunanithi s/o K Kalandavelu (hereinafter referred to as `the dec eased`), a sec urity guard, had a long history of heart trouble, asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus. He suffered a heart attac k in 1984. He had a sec ond heart attac k on 1 August 1997 and was warded in the Tan Toc k Seng Hospital. 

The dec eased took a number of tests while he was in the hospital. On 5 August 1997, a signal average ECG was done. This showed a high risk of ventric ular tarc hic ardia and ventric ular fibrillation. An ec hoc ardiogram was done on 7 August 1997. This revealed that the dec eased`s left ventric ular func tion was severely impaired and that the estimated ejec tion frac tion was only 21%, a worrying result when c ompared to the ejec tion frac tion of a healthy heart. Finally, a sub-maximal exerc ise stress test was done on 7 August 1997. During this test, the dec eased ac hieved his predic ted heart rate without c omplaining of c hest pain and the test was disc ontinued bec ause of fatigue. After evaluating these tests and the dec eased`s overall c ondition, Dr Alfred Cheng, the head of TTSH`s Department of Cardiology and the Direc tor of their Coronary Care Unit, disc harged the dec eased on 8 August 1997, pending a further evaluation of his c ondition. It was arranged that he return to the hospital one month later for a review of his c ondition and for a maximal exerc ise stress test to be c onduc ted. In addition, a c oronary angiogram was sc heduled for late Oc tober 1997. 

Upon his disc harge, the dec eased was given medic ine for his c ondition. He was presc ribed aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation, sorbitrate to improve blood flow to his heart musc les and c aptopril to improve his heart func tion. He was also provided with GTN tablets, whic h were to be taken if he had c hest pains. He was advised that if he had any c hest pain, he was to take the GTN tablet and proc eed immediately to the Ac c ident and Emergenc y Department of the hospital. Unfortunately, the dec eased suffered a fatal heart attac k in the early morning of 16 August 1997. 

**_The plaintiff`s case_** 


Madam Vasuhi c ontended that the dec eased died bec ause he was not given proper and appropriate treatment expec ted of responsible and reasonably c ompetent doc tors. In her statement of c laim, she made the following allegations: 

(a) TTSH`s doc tors failed to c onsider and administer thrombolytic therapy to the dec eased. 

(b) TTSH`s doc tors failed to c onsider and omitted to note that the dec eased had an earlier heart attac k and thus failed to rec ognise that the dec eased had an inc reased risk of another severe heart attac k. 

(c ) TTSH`s doc tors failed to c onsider the risk of an exerc ise stress test so soon after a heart attac k and erroneously relied on the result of an inc omplete exerc ise stress test. 

(d) TTSH`s doc tors failed to note that the dec eased may have had some on-going isc haemia whic h required intervention to prevent another heart attac k. 

(e) TTSH`s doc tors failed to arrange for a c oronary angiogram prior to disc harging the dec eased to determine the appropriate measures to be taken, suc h as by-pass surgery. 

(f) TTSH`s doc tors failed to advise the dec eased and/or his family of the urgenc y of a c oronary angiography even though an ec hoc ardiography showed that the dec eased`s c ondition was serious. 

(g) TTSH`s doc tors failed to arrange for the dec eased to take other tests and investigations. 

Experts` views on whether a c oronary angiogram should have been performed before the dec eased was disc harged 

Madam Vasuhi c ontended that the dec eased was suc h a c ritic ally ill patient that he should not have been disc harged on 8 August 1997 without the benefit of a c oronary angiogram. Her c ase was summed up by her c ounsel, Ms Seenivasan Lalita, in paras 65 and 66 of her written submissions in the following terms: 

 It is therefore submitted that the deceased would not have died if Dr Alfred Cheng had done a coronary angiography prior to discharge where he would have seen how bad the condition of the deceaseds heart was. The coronary angiography would have shown that the deceased was not fit for discharge. He would have to be kept on Heparin and scheduled for by-pass surgery. 

 As the deceased would have been in the care and under close observation of the hospital he would not have suffered the fatal heart attack. 

Madam Vasuhi`s expert witness, Dr Leo Mahar, the Direc tor of Cardiology at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, said that there was a strong possibility that the dec eased had on-going isc haemia and that he required an urgent c oronary angiogram. Dr Mahar added that he would have sc heduled suc h an angiogram within a week after the dec eased`s admission to the hospital. In para 15 of his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief, he opined as follows: 

 My view is that someone of his age should be given the maximum opportunity and that would include early investigation and intervention therapy if indicated. There was a need to conduct a fairly urgent angiography as the deceased had at least two vessel coronary artery disease and was known to have poor left 


 ventricular function. 

TTSH`s expert witnesses, Professor Lim Yean Leng (hereinafter referred to as `Professor Lim`), the Direc tor of the National Heart Centre, and Assoc iate Professor Lim Yean Teng (hereinafter referred to as `Assoc Prof Lim`), the Chief and Senior Consultant Cardiologist at the National University Hospital, did not agree with Dr Mahar that there was a strong possibility that the dec eased had on-going isc haemia or that an urgent c oronary angiogram was c alled for. 

Like Dr Cheng, both Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim took the view that what the dec eased required was an elec tive c oronary angiogram and not an urgent c oronary angiogram. The differenc e between an urgent c oronary angiogram and an elec tive c oronary angiogram was explained by Professor Lim in the following terms: 

 In cardiology, we talk of immediate or urgent (as soon as possible or a matter of days). If not, we talk of elective or delayed. The length of the delay depends on the category of patients. 

Dr Cheng, who said that the dec eased did not have signs of on-going isc haemia, explained that he c ontemplated an urgent c oronary angiogram for the dec eased on 14 August 1997. However, after evaluating the dec eased`s c ase, he thought that an elec tive angiogram was more appropriate than an urgent angiogram. In para 16 of his affidavit of evidenc e-in c hief, he explained: 

 In view of the results of the negative submaximal exercise stress test and the lack of any other clinical indications or symptoms such as continuing chest pain, there was no clinical indication for early coronary angiography for the deceased. Hence, I scheduled the deceased for elective coronary angiography at the Singapore General Hospital, which was then fixed for 23 October 1997, which was the next available date. 

Professor Lim, who endorsed Dr Cheng`s view that the dec eased required an elec tive c oronary angiogram, made it c lear that he would not have required an urgent angiogram to be performed if the dec eased had been his patient. When c ross-examined, he said as follows: 

 Q: ... [W]ould you have considered this patient a candidate for an urgent angiogram? 

 A: If the emphasis is on the word urgent, the answer is no but on the possibility of helping the patient further, an angiogram will help. With the record presented with the patient having no subjective symptoms of ischaemia, usually pain, and no clear cut evidence of ischaemia, there is no urgency to proceed with an angiogram. The decision made in this case was for an elective angiogram. This was appropriate. 

 Q: For this patient, you would not have arranged for an urgent angiogram? 

 A: In this case, the patient is post-infarct, a specific group. He was kept seven days in the hospital. This is the usual practice for uncomplicated cases, ie those with no further chest pain, no failure or dangerous electrical arrythmia. Then, 


 we investigate the further management strategy. The deceased was a patient for an elective angiogram. I would not have arranged for an immediate angiogram. [Emphasis added.] 

Professor Lim stood his ground when it was pointed out to him that the dec eased had an ejec tion frac tion of only 21%. When c ross-examined, he answered as follows: 

 Q: This patient had two heart attacks, congestive failure on the third day, electrical instability, an ejection fraction of 21% and an inconclusive submaximal test. Based on these, I put it to you that the patient should have been given an earliest angiogram. 

 A: If this patient is stable with no symptomatic angina or ischaemia and his heart failure has been treated, he is managed as a stable patient to be discharged for further management. I agree with the management of his case. [Emphasis added.] 

Assoc Prof Lim, who also took the view that the dec eased showed no signs of on-going isc haemia that warranted an urgent angiogram, said as follows during c ross-examination: 

 Q: The reasons why an angiogram should have been done include two heart attacks complicated by heart failure on the third day, uninterpretable stress test results ... 

 A: These are reasons why an angiogram needs to be done but do not qualify for an urgent angiogram ie before the patient can be sent home. Urgency depends on whether the patient has spontaneous or inducible ischaemia. There was no such evidence in this case. 

Assoc Prof Lim also rejec ted the c ontention that the results of the ec hoc ardiography performed on 7 August 1997 should have alerted Dr Cheng that an urgent c oronary angiogram was required. When c ross-examined, he said as follows: 

 Q: After the echocardiograph report, he should not have been discharged? 

 A: The timing of the angiogram is not determined by the result of the echocardiograph. It identifies a high risk patient and we want to study further. But the timing of the angiogram becomes more urgent if the patient has evidence of inducible or spontaneous myocardial ischaemia. In this case, there was no such evidence. Notwithstanding the echocardiograph report, I would have discharged the patient. [Emphasis is added.] 

**_Experts` views on whether there were sufficient grounds for the deceased to be discharged_** 


**_on 8 August 1997_** 

As both Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim thought that the dec eased did not require an urgent angiogram, their view that TTSH had suffic ient grounds for disc harging the dec eased on 8 August 1997 report, will next be c onsidered. 

Dr Cheng, who disc harged the dec eased from hospital, explained that while the dec eased was ill, his c ondition was not suc h as to warrant his c ontinued hospitalisation pending the taking of further tests. He pointed out that by 8 August 1997, the dec eased did not have any c hest pain and his blood pressure was satisfac tory. His lungs were also c lear. There were no ECG c hanges during the submaximal stress test and the dec eased ac hieved 75% of his predic ted heart rate without any c hest pain during the said stress test. In his c onsidered opinion, there was no indic ation of on-going myoc ardial isc haemia. As suc h, the patient was c linic ally stable and c ould be disc harged from hospital. 

Dr Cheng`s dec ision to disc harge the dec eased on 8 August 1997 was endorsed by Professor Lim, who ac c epted that there was a possibility that the dec eased had on-going isc haemia but stressed that this did not mean that the patient c ould not be disc harged. During c ross-examination, he explained: 

 Q: Was it acceptable practice to discharge him? 

 A: With no subjective evidence of ischaemia, it is acceptable practice to discharge him. This may be regarded as conservative management ... 

 Q: You said there was a possibility that the deceased had ischaemia? 

 A: Everyone can have this. A person with a heart attack has a higher possibility of ischaemia. 

Admittedly, Professor Lim would not have plac ed muc h relianc e on the sub-maximal stress test results. However, his evidenc e should be read in its proper c ontext as he made it absolutely c lear that he would have disc harged the dec eased without putting him through a sub-maximal exerc ise stress test on 7 August 1997. 

As for Dr Mahar`s view that the sub-maximal exerc ise stress test results c ould not be interpreted and should not have been relied upon for the purpose of dec iding whether or not it was safe to disc harge the dec eased, Assoc Prof Lim endorsed Dr Cheng`s view that the results c ould be interpreted. In paras 5 and 6 of his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief, Assoc Prof Lim said as follows: 

 5 It is recommended practice for a cardiac patient to undergo a sub-maximal stress test for risk stratification purposes and the test is designed to continue until the patient achieves 75% of his expected maximum heart rate or until the onset of symptoms. This was done for the deceased on 7 August 1997. 

 6 The results of the sub-maximal exercise stress test show that there was no inducible ischaemia and this would indicate that the deceased was safe for discharge. It is wrong to suggest that there was anything significant in the raised ST segments of the ECG. This is not unexpected for patients who have 


 had a Q-wave heart attack. In these patients, it is only when the ST segments are depressed during the exercise stress test or there are onset of ischaemia symptoms would it indicate that there is inducible ischaemia. 

Assoc Prof Lim agreed that it was safe for the dec eased to be disc harged on 8 August 1997. Indeed, after reviewing the position taken by Dr Cheng in the treatment and disc harge of the dec eased, Assoc Prof Lim c onc luded that the management of the dec eased was well within ac c epted prac tic e. 

**_Experts` views on when the elective angiogram should have been performed_** 

If what the dec eased required was an elec tive c oronary angiogram and not an urgent c oronary angiogram, a question arises as to whether the elec tive c oronary angiogram should have been performed before the dec eased died on 16 August 1997, eight days after he was disc harged from the hospital. 

The dec eased`s elec tive c oronary angiogram was sc heduled for 23 Oc tober 1997. Dr Cheng explained that while the waiting time for an elec tive c oronary angiogram is presently very muc h shorter than in 1997 bec ause TTSH now have their own angiography fac ilities, it ought to be noted that in 1997, TTSH did not have in-house fac ilities for angiography and their patients had to be sent to the Singapore General Hospital for a c oronary angiogram to be performed. He testified that while an urgent c oronary angiogram c ould have been performed immediately in 1997, the waiting list in that year for an elec tive angiogram was about two months. Henc e, the dec eased`s c oronary angiogram was sc heduled for 23 Oc tober 1997, whic h was the next available date for suc h an angiogram. 

All three expert witnesses thought that the date given to the dec eased for his c oronary angiogram was rather late although Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim c onc eded that they had no knowledge of the logistic s involved in arranging for suc h an angiogram for TTSH`s patients in 1997. 

Professor Lim said that he would not have sc heduled a c oronary angiogram for the dec eased too soon after his heart attac k on 1 August 1997. This is bec ause the benefits of suc h an angiogram must be balanc ed against the risks of an early c oronary angiogram. He said that unless an urgent angiogram was required, it would be preferable to give the dec eased`s heart some time to repair itself after the heart attac k of 1 August 1997. During c ross-examination, he explained as follows: 

 Q: When would you have done the elective angiogram? 

 A: There is a small additional risk of complications following a mild heart attack in this group of patients versus someone who has not had a heart attack. This risk arises because of recently damaged areas of the heart. The damaged areas can rupture, clot and are electrically more irritable. In the past, unless you had good reasons, you try not to do an angiogram during this period. Nowadays, we are prepared for an angiogram even during a heart attack. By the 1980s, we can do an angiogram and angioplasty during the said period where the benefits outweigh the risks. However, all things being equal, you try not to give a patient an additional risk. [Emphasis is added.] 


Professor Lim said that if the dec eased had been his patient, he would have sc heduled the elec tive c oronary angiogram some two to three weeks after the dec eased`s sec ond heart attac k on 1 August 

1997\. He added that if there had been a waiting list, the c oronary angiogram would have been performed in three weeks. 

Dr Mahar opined that the view that one should allow two to three weeks for a damaged heart to heal before performing a c oronary angiogram is no longer held in Australia and the United States. However, Professor Lim maintained that in the absenc e of c onditions warranting an urgent c oronary angiogram, he would prefer to let a patient`s heart have two to three weeks to heal after a heart attac k before having a c oronary angiogram performed. 

Assoc Prof Lim also agreed that an ac c eptable date for the elec tive c oronary angiogram to be performed in this c ase would have been two to three weeks after the heart attac k on 1 August 1997. 

**_The Bolam test_** 

A disc ussion of the duty of a doc tor to a patient ought to begin with a c onsideration of the **_Bolam_** test, whic h was stated by Mc Nair J in **Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee** [1957] 2 All ER 118[1957] 1 WLR 582, in the following terms: 

 I myself would prefer to put it this way: A doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art ... Putting it the other way round, a doctor is not negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely because there is a body of opinion that takes a contrary view. 

The **_Bolam_** test has been subjec t to muc h sc rutiny, and espec ially so, in rec ent times. (See, for instanc e, **Hucks v Cole** [1993] 4 Med LR 393, a dec ision of the English Court of Appeal, **Edward Wong Finance Co v Johnson Stokes & Master** [1984] AC 1296, a dec ision of the Privy Counc il, and **Rogers v Whitaker** [1992] 175 CLR 479, a dec ision of the High Court of Australia.) All the same, in **Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority** [1998] AC 232[1997] 4 All ER 771, the **_Bolam_** test was ac c epted by the House of Lords as `[t]he loc us c lassic us of the test for the standard of c are required of a doc tor or any other person professing some skill or c ompetenc e`. 

In the fac e of widely differing views from medic al experts, it would be appropriate to bear in mind the following words of Lord Sc arman in **Maynard v West Midlands Regional Health Authority** [1985] 1 All ER 635[1984] 1 WLR 634: 

 I do not think that the words of the Lord President (Clyde) in Hunter v Hanley 1955 SLT 213 at 217 can be bettered: 

 In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is ample scope for genuine difference of opinion and one man clearly is not negligent merely because his conclusion differs from that of other professional men ... The true test for establishing negligence in diagnosis or treatment on the part of a doctor is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no doctor of ordinary skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care ... 

 ... Differences of opinion and practice exist, and will always exist, in the medical as in other professions. There is seldom any one answer exclusive of all others 


 to problems of professional judgment. A court may prefer one body of opinion to the other, but that is no basis for a conclusion of negligence. 

It does not follow that a defendant doc tor or hospital will avoid liability for negligent treatment merely bec ause there is evidenc e from a number of medic al experts to the effec t that the treatment ac c orded to a patient ac c ords with what other doc tors might have done. In **_Bolitho_** (supra), Lord Browne-Wilkinson put the matter in its proper perspec tive when he said as follows (at [1998] AC 232, 241-242; [1997] 4 All ER 771, 778): 

 In the Bolam case itself, McNair J [1957] 1 WLR 583, 587 stated that the defendant had to have acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men ... [T]he court has to be satisfied that the exponents of the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical basis. In particular, in cases involving, as they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonable or respectable, will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter. 

In **Hucks v Cole** [1993] 4 Med LR 393, the Court of Appeal ac c epted that a defendant doc tor was negligent in failing to treat with penic illin a patient who was suffering from septic plac es on her skin though he knew them to c ontain organisms c apable of leading to puerperal fever despite the fac t that a number of distinguished doc tors gave evidenc e that they would not, in the c irc umstanc es, have treated the patient with penic illin. In that c ase, Sac hs LJ pointed out at p 397 that where the evidenc e shows that a lac una in professional prac tic e exists by whic h risks of grave danger are knowingly taken, then, however small the risk, the c ourt must anxiously examine that lac una, and partic ularly so if the risk c an be easily and inexpensively avoided. His Lordship added that if the c ourt finds, on an analysis of the reasons given for not taking those prec autions that, in the light of c urrent professional knowledge, there is no proper basis for the lac una, and that it is definitely not reasonable that those risks should have been taken, its func tion is to state that fac t and where nec essary to state that it c onstitutes negligenc e. His Lordship had no doubt that in suc h a c ase, the prac tic e will be altered for the benefit of patients. 

It ought to be noted that a judge should not be too quic k to substitute his opinion for that of medic al experts. In **_Bolitho_** (supra), Lord Browne-Wilkinson c autioned against suc h speed when he said as follows (at [1998] AC 232, 243; [1997] 4 All ER 771, 779): 

 I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a judge to reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a competent medical expert are unreasonable. The assessment of medical risks and benefits is a matter of clinical judgment which a judge would not normally be able to make without expert evidence ... [I]t would be wrong to allow such assessment to deteriorate into seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views both of which are capable of being logically supported. It is only where a judge can be satisfied that the body of expert opinion cannot be logically supported at all that such opinion will not provide the benchmark by reference to which the defendants conduct falls to be assessed. 


**_My findings_** 

When c losely examined, Madam Vasuhi`s c ase rests mainly on the assertion that TTSH`s doc tors failed to realise that the dec eased was a high risk patient for whom c onservative treatment was inappropriate and that TTSH`s doc tors were negligent when they failed to perform a c oronary angiogram before disc harging the dec eased on 8 August 1997. 

Some of Madam Vasuhi`s allegations of negligenc e c an be dismissed at the outset. To begin with, the c omplaint that TTSH`s doc tors failed to administer thrombolytic therapy to the dec eased is without c ause. Suc h therapy, whic h involves the intravenous injec tion of a drug into a patient`s blood stream to dissolve blood c lots that may be oc c luding the c oronary arteries, may not help a patient suc h as the dec eased, who was admitted to the hospital more than 11 hours after the onset of c hest pain. Heart musc le whic h has been deprived of blood supply for more than 11 hours would probably be nec rotic and the restoration of blood flow would not be benefic ial. Besides, the blood c lots, if any, would be muc h more diffic ult to dissolve. The potentially serious and even life-threatening effec ts of suc h therapy, inc luding the risk of stroke and haemorrhage, must be balanc ed against the minimal benefits to suc h a patient. It is for the doc tor managing the c ase to dec ide whether or not to administer thrombolytic therapy and in the c irc umstanc es of this c ase, TTSH c annot be faulted for not administering the said therapy to the dec eased. 

Madam Vasuhi`s sec ond assertion, namely, that TTSH`s doc tors failed to note that the dec eased had an earlier heart attac k in 1984, is baseless as it was evident that TTSH`s doc tors knew that they were treating a patient who has had a previous heart attac k. The previous heart attac k had been rec orded at the time of admission and in the medic al c ase-notes after the dec eased was hospitalised. 

Madam Vasuhi`s next assertion that TTSH`s doc tors failed to c onsider the risk of an exerc ise stress test so soon after his heart attac k must also be rejec ted. It was not alleged that the stress test in question c aused or was a c ontributory c ause of the dec eased`s death. In any c ase, Dr Mahar did not say that it was wrong for the sub-maximal exerc ise stress test to have been c arried out on 7 August 

1997\. He merely said that the results of this test were uninterpretable. 

Madam Vasuhi`s assertion that an elec trophysiology study and a nuc lear sc an should have been done is also groundless. Dr Mahar ac c epted that an elec trophysiology study would not have shed muc h light on whether or not the dec eased had on-going isc haemia. As for a nuc lear sc an, it appears that, as a general rule, the next stage of inquiry for a patient suc h as the dec eased is a c oronary angiogram and not a nuc lear sc an. 

As for the suggestion that the use of an implantable defibrillator c ould have been c onsidered, it was not the prac tic e to use implantable defibrillators in 1997. 

If the unsubstantiated allegations of negligenc e referred to above are left aside, whether or not TTSH are liable to Madam Vasuhi for the death of her husband depends on the answers to the following questions: 

(a) Was it proper for the dec eased to be disc harged on 8 August 1997? 

(b) If it was proper, was the dec eased`s death c aused by any unjustifiable delay on the part of TTSH`s doc tors to arrange an elec tive c oronary angiogram for him? 

On the evidenc e, I am satisfied that it has not been established that Dr Cheng was negligent in 


dec iding on an elec tive c oronary angiogram for the dec eased. While Dr Mahar would have arranged for an urgent c oronary angiogram for the dec eased, Prof Lim, Assoc Prof Lim and Dr Cheng furnished sound and very ac c eptable reasons for adopting the view that an elec tive c oronary angiogram was what the dec eased required. 

As Dr Cheng was entitled to take the view that the dec eased did not require an urgent c oronary angiogram, Madam Vasuhi`s c omplaint that he failed to inform the dec eased or his family members that the dec eased required an urgent c oronary angiogram or that an urgent c oronary angiogram c ould have been performed at an earlier date at another medic al establishment must be dismissed. 

I am also satisfied that Dr Cheng was not negligent in relying on the available test results and on his own assessment of the dec eased`s c ondition for the purpose of dec iding whether or not to disc harge the dec eased from the hospital on 8 August 1997. It was alleged that Dr Cheng did not have all the fac ts before him when he disc harged the dec eased from the hospital. In partic ular, she alleged that Dr Cheng did not review the ec hoc ardiogram report of 7 August 1997 before disc harging the dec eased. She pointed out that Dr Cheng had wrongly stated the date of the ec hoc ardiogram as 11 August 1997 in, inter alia, his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief. Dr Cheng explained that the error was a typographic al error. He said that he must have seen the ec hoc ardiogram report bec ause its findings were mentioned in the Inpatient Disc harge Summary dated 8 August 1997. I believe Dr Cheng and henc e, this matter need not be c onsidered any further. 

The c ritic ism that Dr Cheng relied primarily on the sub-maximal exerc ise stress test for the purpose of dec iding whether or not to disc harge the dec eased has not been overlooked. Dr Cheng denied that he based his dec ision to disc harge the dec eased primarily on the results of the sub-maximal exerc ise stress test. When c ross-examined, he said as follows: 

 Q: You relied primarily on the sub-maximal stress test when discharging him. 

 A: No. I made an assessment of the patients suitability for discharge from hospital on the basis of his clinical condition, his symptoms or lack of them, clinical examination, supported by investigations such as the exercise stress test. Other tests would be taken into consideration such as the echocardiogram and the signal averaged ECG. Based on all these, I decided to discharge him. 

As for the assertion that the sub-maximal exerc ise stress test results should not have been relied on bec ause the test was inc omplete, Dr Cheng explained that this was not true. In para 14 of his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief, he stated as follows: 

 [I]t is not correct to suggest that the stress test was incomplete. The submaximal exercise stress test is meant to be terminated at 70-75 per cent of the predicted maximal heart rate or the onset of symptoms. Based on the ECG readings, the deceased achieved a total exercise time of 9 minutes and 33 seconds and reached a heart rate of about 76% of his age predicted heart rate. 

 During the exercise stress test, the deceased did not develop any chest pain and there was no significant ST segment depression which would have indicated evidence of significant myocardial ischaemia. 


As it has not been established that Dr Cheng was negligent in disc harging the dec eased on 8 August 1997 or in dec iding that the dec eased did not require an urgent angiogram, the only remaining question is whether the dec eased`s death was c aused by any delay on the part of TTSH in arranging for the elec tive c oronary angiogram. 

As has been mentioned, Dr Cheng sc heduled the dec eased`s c oronary angiogram for 23 Oc tober 

1997\. Whether or not TTSH should have arranged for the dec eased`s elec tive c oronary angiogram to be performed at an earlier date, it should be borne in mind that in **_Bolitho_** (supra), the House of Lords reiterated that where a breac h of a duty of c are is proved or admitted, the burden still lies on the plaintiff to prove that suc h breac h c aused the injury suffered. 

In **_Bolitho_** `s c ase, a c hild who had respiratory trouble was admitted to hospital. On the following day, his breathing deteriorated at 12.40pm and a nurse summoned the doc tor in c harge of his c ase by telephone. The doc tor did not turn up but the c hild rec overed. However, at 2pm, he suffered another bout of ac ute respiratory diffic ulty. The nurse reported this to the doc tor by telephone. The doc tor again did not turn up. The c hild apparently rec overed and looked muc h better after a while. At 2.30pm, the c hild c ollapsed due to a failure of his respiratory system, as a result of whic h he had a c ardiac arrest. By the time, his respiratory and c ardiac func tions were restored, the c hild had sustained severe brain damage. Eventually, the c hild died and his parents sued the health authority for damages for negligenc e. The trial judge held that the doc tor had been in breac h of duty in failing to attend to the c hild when summoned by the nurse. Negligenc e having been established, the question of c ausation had to be determined. The issue before the c ourt was whether the c ardiac arrest would have been avoided if the doc tor in c harge or any suitable deputy had attended to the c hild at an earlier stage. It was c ommon ground that intubation so as to provide an airway in any event would have ensured that the respiratory failure whic h oc c urred did not lead to c ardiac arrest and that suc h intubation would have had to be c arried out before the final episode of respiratory failure. Five experts gave evidenc e that after the sec ond episode of respiratory failure, any c ompetent doc tor would have intubated. On the other hand, the defendants` experts took a different view. One of them testified that the c hild`s symptoms did not show a progressive respiratory c ollapse and there was only a small risk of total respiratory failure, a small risk whic h had to be balanc ed against submitting the c hild to the invasive proc edure of intubation, whic h was not a routine risk-free proc ess. In the fac e of suc h c onflic ting expert evidenc e with respec t to whether intubation should have been done, the trial judge ac c epted that it had not been established that the defendants` admitted breac h of duty had c aused the c atastrophe to the c hild. His dec ision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal [1994] 1 Med LR 381. The plaintiff`s appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed. Lord Browne-Wikinson said that it c ould not be suggested that it was illogic al for the defendants` expert witness to favour running a small risk of total respiratory c ollapse rather than to submit the c hild to the invasive proc edure of intubation. 

It is c lear from **_Bolitho_** `s c ase that even if it is ac c epted that in the present c ase, the dec eased should have been given an earlier date for an elec tive c oronary angiogram, it must be established that the dec eased`s death was c aused by the delay. As has been mentioned, both Prof Lim and Assoc Prof Lim testified that if the dec eased had been their patient, they would have arranged for his elec tive c oronary angiogram to be performed some two to three weeks after his heart attac k on 1 August 1997, whic h is sometime between the middle of August 1997 and one week thereafter. 

It must be stressed that what is c ruc ial is not what Professor Lim or Assoc Prof Lim might themselves have done but whether or not they furnished sound and ac c eptable reasons for their suggested timing for the dec eased`s elec tive c oronary angiogram to be performed. In this regard, both of them provided c ogent reasons as to why it was preferable for the elec tive c oronary angiogram to be performed some two to three weeks after the dec eased`s heart attac k on 1 August 1997. I thus 


ac c ept that TTSH c annot be faulted even if the elec tive c oronary angiogram for the dec eased had been sc heduled for the third week of August 1997. 

Regrettably, the dec eased passed away during the early morning of 16 August 1997, only eight days after his disc harge from the hospital. As suc h, even if the logistic s of arranging an elec tive angiogram for TTSH`s patients in 1997 are not taken into ac c ount, the fac t remains that the dec eased died well before the ac c eptable deadline for TTSH to send him for an elec tive c oronary angiogram. Professor Lim summed up the position as follows in his letter dated 19 Dec ember 2000 to the Chairman of the Medic al Board of the defendant hospital: 

 The patient suffered a cardiac arrest eight days after he was discharged. With the results of the investigations prior to discharge, I personally would not have arranged for a diagnostic coronary angiogram to be performed within these eight days. [Emphasis is added.] 

As the dec eased died before the expiry of the period within whic h TTSH may be expec ted to have arranged for him to have an elec tive c oronary angiogram, it c annot be said that TTSH`s delay in arranging the angiogram in question was a c ause of the dec eased`s death. In fac t, Professor Lim went so far as to say that even if the elec tive c oronary angiogram had been performed on 14 August 1997, he would, on the basis of the findings in the autopsy report, not have kept the dec eased in hospital after the angiogram. Neither would he, without more, have, as Dr Mahar suggested, presc ribed heparin for the dec eased while further investigations were being c onduc ted. During c rossexamination, he said as follows: 

 Q: If an angiogram had been done on 14 August 1997, you would have admitted him to hospital? 

 A: No. A person reading it will say that this person may benefit from surgery. There will be a long consultative process. No heparin will be prescribed unless his condition is unstable. Whether this patient is unstable depends on chest pains and objective symptoms of angina. This patient is a post-infarct 14-day patient. 

 Q: If an angiogram had been done on 14 August 1997, it would have shown the condition of the heart as in the autopsy report? 

 A: Yes but he could still have died on the 16th from ruptured haemorrhagic plaque ... This would be so even with heparin. 

In view of my finding that the dec eased`s death was not c aused by any delay on the part of TTSH in arranging an elec tive c oronary angiogram for him, it is unnec essary for me to c onsider the lengthy arguments raised by both parties as to whether a heart by-pass operation would have benefited the dec eased. All the same, it ought to be noted that on this issue, the experts were sharply divided. While Dr Mahar was more optimistic about the benefits of suc h an operation for the dec eased, both Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim said that the additional tests required before a dec ision on suc h an operation c an be made c ould not have been c ompleted before the dec eased died on 16 August 1997. Assoc Prof Lim added that revasc ularisation surgery for the dec eased would have been highly risky bec ause of his poor left ventric ular systolic func tion and the fac t that he had systemic lupus 


erythematosus. 

In the final analysis, whether or not the approac h of TTSH`s doc tors to the treatment of the dec eased is ac c eptable depends on whether or not a c onservative approac h to the treatment of the dec eased was justified. Given the c irc umstanc es of the c ase, it has not been established that the approac h adopted by TTSH`s doc tors was wrong. Madam Vasuhi`s c laim against TTSH is thus dismissed with c osts. 

## Outcome: 

Claim dismissed.
