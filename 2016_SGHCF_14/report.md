**Choo Han Teck J:** 

1       Three wars were fought the day after Carthage and Rome realised that they c ould not live together side by side. The Punic Wars as they are known lasted more than a c entury from 261 BCE. 

2       This summons arose from the third of three divorc e trials in the long drawn matrimonial dispute between the husband and the wife. In this summons, the applic ant (husband) seeks an extension of time to file his appellant’s c ase whic h fell due on 12 September 2016. The applic ant (husband) married the respondent (wife) a long time ago on 6 Marc h 1990. They have a daughter who is now 23 years old and two sons who are 19 and 18 years old. In Dec ember 2001 the wife filed the first of three divorc e suits against the husband. The c laim, whic h was based on the ground of unreasonable behaviour of the husband was c hallenged by the husband, and after a trial on the merits, the suit was dismissed in May 2005. In Dec ember 2010 the wife filed the sec ond divorc e ac tion on the ground of four years separation with effec t from 17 Marc h 2006 but when the husband c hallenged the ac tion the wife amended the ac tion and c laimed a divorc e on the ground of unreasonable behaviour. The sec ond ac tion was also c ontested and eventually dismissed. The wife then filed the third divorc e suit on 26 February 2015 on the ground that they had been separated for four years prec eding the divorc e applic ation, namely, from 28 June 2010. The husband c ounterc laimed on two grounds, first, on the ground of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the wife, and sec ondly, on the ground of desertion. This third divorc e ac tion was also c ontested and the trial lasted six days. 

3       The learned distric t judge allowed the wife’s c laim for divorc e on the ground of a four-year separation. She also allowed the husband’s c ounterc laim for divorc e on the ground of desertion, but she dismissed the husband’s c ounterc laim on the ground of unreasonable behaviour. The husband, fearing that the rejec tion by the learned distric t judge of the wife’s c onduc t would be prejudic ial to him at the anc illary proc eedings, intends to appeal the judge’s dismissal of that ground but says that he is out of time in filing the appellant’s c ase whic h was due on 12 September 2016. He filed this applic ation for an extension of time on 9 September 2016 under Rule 834 of the Family Justic e Rules 2014 (“FJR”). He c laims that he needs a further four to six weeks bec ause he would like to c onsult a lawyer for the appeal and has been told by the lawyers he has c onsulted that unless he has an extension of time, they are not able to ac c ept his brief and represent him. The wife objec ts to this applic ation and c laims that the husband is delaying proc eedings to deprive her of her share of the matrimonial assets. The anc illary proc eedings have not yet begun. 


4       Rule 827 of the FJR states the obligation of the appellant to file and serve his/her c ase on the respondent: 

 Record of appeal and Appellant’s Case 

 (1) Within one month after servic e of the notic e referred to in rule 826(3), the appellant must — 

 (a) file the rec ord of appeal, and subjec t to rule 828, the Appellant’s Case referred to in that rule; and 

 (b) serve a c opy eac h of the rec ord of appeal and the Appellant’s Case on every respondent to the appeal or his solic itor. 

 ... 

 (5) Where an appellant fails to c omply with paragraph (1), the appeal shall be deemed to have been withdrawn, but nothing in this rule shall be deemed to limit or restric t the powers of the Family Division of the High Court to extend time. 

5       Rule 834 of the FJR provides that the c ourt may grant an extension of time in this c ase: 

 Extension of time 

 834. Without prejudic e to the power of the Family Division of the High Court under rule 15, to extend the time presc ribed by any provision of this Division, the period for filing and serving the notic e of appeal under rule 825 may be extended by the Court below on applic ation made before the expiration of that period. 

6       In exerc ising its disc retion on whether to grant an applic ation for an extension of time, the c ourt takes into ac c ount the following fac tors: 

 (a) Length of the delay; 

 (b) Reasons for the delay; 

 (c ) Merits of the appeal, ie , c hanc es of the appeal suc c eeding if time is extended; and 

 (d) Prejudic e to the respondent if the applic ation is granted. 

7       At the time I heard this applic ation, about five weeks had passed sinc e the appellant’s c ase was due on 12 September 2016 and seven months sinc e the Notic e of Appeal was filed on 7 April 

2016\. This is not an insignific ant length of time. I find that the husband’s reason for his inability to retain a lawyer to represent him is unc onvinc ing. Having filed the Notic e of Appeal on 7 April 2016, the husband had around six months to retain and instruc t c ounsel for the purpose of the appeal. 

8       Furthermore, I find that there is little c hanc e that the husband’s appeal against the learned distric t judge’s dismissal of the grounds of unreasonable behaviour of the wife would suc c eed even if time is extended for the husband to file his c ase. The husband was previously a doc tor who ran his own c linic and also operated a bubble tea shop in the same premises as his c linic. The wife is an ac c ountant but had worked as the husband’s c linic assistant. In her grounds of dec ision, the learned distric t judge summarised the husband’s allegations of unreasonable behaviour by the wife as follows: 


 (a) The husband alleged that the wife c omplained to the Central Provident Fund (‘CPF’) Board that the husband did not make CPF c ontributions to a staff of the c linic and bubble tea shop. The CPF Board fined both husband and wife when it was found that the wife was the one responsible for filing the CPF forms and in c harge of paying the staff. In Dec ember 2001 the wife resigned from the husband’s c linic and c omplained to the CPF Board that the husband did not pay her CPF c ontributions. The husband was c harged in c ourt. When the CPF found that it was the wife who had c ompleted the forms dec laring that she had left the c linic , the husband was ac quitted by the c ourt. 

 (b) When the wife was working for the husband’s bubble tea shop, she stole medic ine from his c linic (whic h shared premises with the bubble tea shop) and sold them illegally at the bubble tea shop. The wife then c omplained to the Ministry of Health (‘MOH’) and the Singapore Medic al Counc il (‘SMC’) that the husband sold c ontrolled medic ine illegally. The husband was c harged in c ourt but was ac quitted when the c ourt found that it was the wife who sold the medic ine at the bubble tea shop without the husband’s knowledge. 

 (c ) The wife then c omplained to the Corrupt Prac tic es Investigation Bureau (‘CPIB’) that the husband bribed two of his patients to testify for him. She also c omplained to the polic e on the ground of extortion when the patients wanted to be paid $3,000 for testifying. After a 15-day trial the husband was ac quitted when it was found that the wife had offered the two patients $50,000 if they did not testify. 

 (d) The wife also c omplained to MOH and the Health Sc ienc es Authority (‘HSA’) that the husband illegally imported medic ine from Malaysia. MOH and HSA offic ers raided the c linic but c ould not find any suc h medic ine. Subsequently, the wife informed the authorities where exac tly the medic ine c ould be found. Not only was it in a c ounter that only the wife had ac c ess, but the allegation of illegal importation did not c onvinc e the HSA that an offenc e had been c ommitted by the husband bec ause the c osts of the medic ine did not justify the transport c osts of importation. 

 (e) In August 2001, the wife c omplained to the Ministry of Environment (‘MOE’) that the bubble tea shop did not display its lic enc e. For this a verbal warning was issued to the husband. The wife then went to the MOE and terminated the bubble tea lic enc e and the husband had to reapply for a new lic enc e. The husband managed to reinstate the lic ense. The wife then c omplained to the MOH that the bubble tea shop and the c linic were sharing premises, forc ing the husband to c lose down the bubble tea shop. 

 (f ) In April 2002, the wife c omplained to the polic e that the husband forged her signature to c ash a c heque. The polic e found that the signature was in fac t that of the wife’s, and no ac tion was thus taken against the husband. 

 (g) In September 2003, when the husband was fac ing the c orruption c harges, the wife applied for an injunc tion to freeze his bank ac c ount so that he c ould not afford to engage a lawyer. Her applic ation was dismissed with c osts fixed at $300. The husband deduc ted that sum from the maintenanc e, but she then applied for enforc ement of her maintenanc e. She had also applied to garnish his bank ac c ount for failing to pay her c osts in her maintenanc e appeal. His ac c ount was suspended initially but after it was asc ertained that the c osts was protec ted by a sec urity payment that was still in the High Court, the assistant registrar reinstated the husband’s ac c ount. 

9       The learned distric t judge also noted the husband’s allegations on the wife’s unreasonable behaviour towards the c hildren: 


 (a) The wife had c omplained to the polic e against the husband for c hild abuse in June 2004. The polic e investigated but found no c ause for ac tion. 

 (b) In January 2006, the wife had beaten one of the c hildren so badly the c hild had to be treated in a hospital, but the husband pleaded with the polic e not to prosec ute the wife. 

 (c ) Sometime in July 2005, the wife returned home one morning and was unable to open the gate. The manner in whic h she attempted to forc e it open agitated the family’s two Rottweiler dogs and when one of their c hildren (then aged 7) ran out on hearing the wife’s shouting, the dogs attac ked the c hild so severely that the c hild’s ear was bitten off. The wife subsequently c laimed an inc rease in maintenanc e on the ground that eventually the c hild would require rec onstruc tive surgery. Her applic ation was denied. That dec ision seemed more inc lined against finding merit in the wife’s c laim for an inc rease in maintenanc e than the fac t that the c hild would require surgery in the future. 

10     In her grounds of dec ision, the learned distric t judge noted the wife’s responses to the husband’s allegations. In brief, the underlying fac ts were not denied but the wife denied the inferenc es and added her own impressions to them. For example, she explained that she reported her husband to the polic e after the Rottweilers attac ked their c hild on the ground that the dogs’ lic enc es were issued in her husband’s name. She also c laimed that there were c omplaints by the public against the husband’s inability to restrain his dogs. The wife denied being ordered to pay the CPF penalty jointly with the husband but instead said that she paid the penalty out of goodwill to resolve the c ase amic ably. She denied offering a bribe to the two patients, c laiming that had she done so she would have been c harged herself. She c ould not rec all if she reported her husband for illegally importing drugs. She maintains that she had not falsely ac c used her husband of forging her signature on any c heque. The wife also denies that the c hildren are against her even though the trial judge noted that one of the c hildren was found by the sc hool c ounsellor to be ‘suic idal and murderous’. The husband explained that that c hild in question wanted to return home to kill the mother (the wife). It also transpired that some years later, the three c hildren testified in the divorc e ac tion on behalf of the husband against their mother. 

11     The learned distric t judge c onsidered the evidenc e and c onc luded that the husband’s ground of unreasonable behaviour had not been proved. The learned distric t judge noted that the most of the events c onc erned took plac e more than 10 years ago before or during the period of rec onc iliation. The learned distric t judge also observed that the husband did not file any c ounterc laims on unreasonable behaviour in the first and sec ond divorc e applic ations by the wife. In fac t, it was the husband’s c ase at the present divorc e applic ation that between 2010 and 2012, the parties had slept together, had dinners and walks together, and had ac tivities with the c hildren together. Given the c irc umstanc es and evidenc e, I agree with the learned distric t judge that, strange as it might be, the husband had attempted rec onc iliation with the wife and therefore c ould not have found it intolerable to live with her up to immediately prior to the filing of the c urrent divorc e applic ation. The husband’s c laims on the unreasonable behaviour of the wife is insuffic ient but only insofar as they c annot be used to justify a ground for divorc e. The fac ts, if they are indeed true, remain for c onsideration if nec essary in the proc eedings for the post-divorc e anc illary orders. For the reasons given by the learned distric t judge, I think that the appeal will not likely suc c eed. 

12     There is a point that neither side raised at the hearing before me, but from the c ourt’s grounds of dec ision, it seems that the parties had separated sinc e 28 June 2010, the date the learned distric t judge also found as the c ommenc ement of the wife’s desertion. If the operative date was indeed 28 June 2010, the husband’s c laim was c orrec tly granted but the wife’s c laim ought to have been dismissed. She should not be granted a divorc e based on a four-year separation whic h is a neutral 


ground with no adverse inferenc e or finding of fault. Desertion is a fault-based ground. The wife c annot avoid the fault of desertion just bec ause the desertion was long enough to satisfy the fouryear time period for the no-fault ground of separation. Desertion is a fault that is redeemed only when the guilty party returns and the other spouse ac c epts the return; it is not c leansed by the mere passage of time. The wife takes the opposite view (in an email after the hearing), namely, that if the learned distric t judge granted the divorc e on her ground of four-year separation, then she ought not to have granted the husband’s c laim for desertion. She made this submission even though she has not appealed. This point is not relevant to the husband’s applic ation before me but may be material to the husband’s c onc erns regarding the future of those past events. 

13     The fac t remains that the learned distric t judge made a finding of fac t that the parties separated on 28 June 2010. On that basis and also on the wife’s desertion, she granted an interim judgment for divorc e. The c laims by the husband that the wife had ac ted unreasonably are neither nec essary nor suffic ient (bec ause they mostly oc c urred before the rec onc iliation period) for him to obtain a divorc e sinc e he has already suc c eeded on the ground of desertion. With the perfec t lens of hindsight it is obvious that this marriage was doomed 16 years ago. The parties have now been given a divorc e with only the anc illaries to be dealt with. For the purposes of the anc illaries, the c onduc t of both parties may still be relevant and they will have to be assessed by the trial judge for their worth in those proc eedings. There is no point to c ontinue with the appeal. The parties ought to proc eed to have the anc illary c laims tried expeditiously — even the Punic Wars ended finally after the third war. 

14     I therefore dismiss the husband’s applic ation for an extension of time to file his c ase for appeal. The parties are to proc eed with the anc illary proc eedings in the family c ourt. Sc ipio the Roman general said to Hannibal before the Battle of Zama in Oc tober 202 BCE to prepare to fight if he found peac e intolerable. Things turned nasty for both Carthaginians and Romans thereafter, but then they had no c ourt to ensure a c ivil or sensible resolution of their quarrel. Here, the rec riminations between the husband and the wife are rife, and although the c ourt will no doubt hear all their c laims, it is not bound to allow them to dwell on petty points.
