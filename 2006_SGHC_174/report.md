29 September 2006 _Judgment reserved._ 

**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       Abidally Abdul Husain alias Abidally Abdul Husain (son of Abdul Husain) (“the dec eased”), a Muslim gentleman, died on 16 May 2003. He had made a will dated 13 January 1992, and exec uted a letter dated 5 November 2000 whic h was referred to as a “letter of wishes” in these proc eedings. 

2       By the will, the dec eased made bequests of one third of his property to his grandc hildren and some other persons. It is very likely that he had kept the bequests to that level bec ause he was aware or was advised that under Muslim law, a person c an dispose of up to one third of his property by his will. 

3       In the handwritten letter of wishes, the dec eased stated: 

 To all my Children 

 These are my wishes regarding my Estate 

 ... 

 (2) All my Cash Balanc e in my POSB OUB and INDIAN BANK A/c to be distributed equally (& not ac c ording to Muslim law) amongs [ sic ] all my 6 Childrens [ sic ]. 

Those three ac c ounts (“the joint ac c ounts”) were held in the joint names of the dec eased and the sec ond defendant. 

**The parties** 

4       The dec eased was a widower with six c hildren, two sons and four daughters, and 13 grandc hildren. The plaintiff Husain Safdar Abidally is the sec ond son and fourth c hild. The first defendant Shiraz Abidally Husain, also known as Shiraz Abidally Abdul Husain, is the first son and first c hild, and the sec ond defendant Mrs Salma Moiz nee Salma d/o Abidally Abdul Husain is the sec ond 


daughter and third c hild. The two defendants are the exec utor and exec utrix of the dec eased’s will. Although they and their siblings are referred to as the dec eased’s c hildren, they are mature adults. 

**The dispute** 

5       When the ac tion was c ommenc ed by the plaintiff, there were two issues in dispute: 

 (a) whether the letter of wishes was null and void , and 

 (b) whether the money in the joint ac c ounts belonged to the sec ond defendant upon the death of the dec eased. 

The sec ond issue arose bec ause the sec ond defendant took the position that the money in the joint ac c ounts belonged to her as the surviving ac c ount holder. 

6       The sec ond issue was settled shortly before the hearing of the ac tion when the sec ond defendant made an offer to settle in her personal c apac ity to treat the money in the joint ac c ounts as money belonging to the dec eased’s estate, and the offer was ac c epted by the plaintiff. By that settlement, that dispute was disposed of. 

7       Counsel for the defendants informed me of the settlement on the first day of the hearing, and of the parties’ agreement that the issue that remains to be determined is: 

 whether or not there was an agreement between the six c hildren of the dec eased (two sons and four daughters) that the joint ac c ounts monies would be distributed between the six of them, at least to the extent of 2/3 now in equal shares and not in ac c ordanc e with Syariah law. 

8       Counsel for the plaintiff c onfirmed that and made it c lear that: 

 The only c ontention --bone of c ontention ... is whether there was an agreement to distribute the 2/3 equally between the siblings. ... I reiterate my c lient’s position as far as payment of 1/3 of the 3 bank monies was c onc erned. There was never a c onc ession that that 1/3 be deduc ted before the 2/3 was earlier distributed. 

**The agreed points under Muslim law** 

9       The hearing proc eeded on the c ommon ground that under Muslim law: 

 (a) the dec eased c annot dispose of more than one third of his estate by his will; 

 (b) a letter of wishes is not binding on the benefic iaries, but they c an agree to c omply with it; 

 (c ) the benefic iaries to an estate under Muslim law c an agree to vary the apportionment of their shares that are presc ribed by Muslim law; 

 (d) the dec eased’s c hildren c an agree to vary their shares to two-thirds of the money in the joint ac c ounts, but they c annot agree to vary the distribution of all the money in the joint ac c ounts; and 

 (e) in the absenc e of any agreement, eac h of the dec eased’s sons would rec eive twic e the share of eac h of the dec eased’s daughters in two thirds of the money in the joint ac c ounts.

**The events leading to the distribution** 

10     The dec eased died on 16 May 2003. Two days later on 18 May, the dec eased’s letter of wishes was disc overed. All the c hildren bec ame aware of its c ontents and dec ided that the dec eased’s wish was to be c omplied with. 

11     On the following day, 19 May, the dec eased’s will was disc overed and its c ontents were made known to the c hildren. On the same day, the sec ond defendant took steps to distribute the money in c omplianc e with the letter of wishes. There is some disagreement on the exac t sequenc e of events on 19 May, but nothing turns on it. 

12     On 7 August 2003, the plaintiff objec ted to the equal distribution of the money and asserted his right to his entitlement under Muslim law. 

**The plaintiff’s case** 

13     In para 7 of his affidavit of 26 July 2005 the plaintiff deposed that: 

 As an heir to the estate of the dec eased I have not c onsented to the equal distribution of the bank moneys amongst the male and female c hildren. 

adding in para 30 that: 

 Everyone thought on 18th that the letter of wishes was his testament and was compliable. [emphasis added] 

a term he used again under c ross-examination by whic h he was probably referring to the point in [9(d)] hereof, and reiterating in para 33: 

 I totally disagree ... that the siblings had unanimously agreed or c onsented to the equal distribution of the bank moneys amongst themselves. 

14     The position taken by the plaintiff in his affidavit is repeated in the opening statement: “The Plaintiff has and still denies this alleged c onsent of the equal distribution by him, or anyone else as far as he knows.” 

15     The plaintiff’s position shifted slightly during the hearing. At that stage, he explained that he had agreed to c omply with the dec eased’s letter of wishes bec ause he thought he had to obey the wishes , and that he had subsequently c hanged his mind when he realised that the dec eased’s wishes c ould not be c arried out without his c onsent. 

16     At the c lose of the c ase, c ounsel for the plaintiff stated: 

 [T]he only issue before the Court for trial was whether there was ... an alleged agreement on 18 May 2003 exc luding the applic ation of the Muslim law ... and ac c epting instead the equal distribution as desired by the dec eased. 

17     The plaintiff’s submissions did not take up the point that the plaintiff thought the letter of wishes was binding on him. The c losest it c ame to that was that “he [the plaintiff ] took the equal share bec ause he took the Letter of Wishes as the dec eased’s _directive_ , not bec ause of any 

 [note: 5] 

 [note: 6] 

 [note: 7] [note: 8] 

 [note: 9] 

 [note: 10] 


_agreement_ ” [emphasis in original] but nothing turned on that in the end. 

**The defendants’ case** 

18     The defendants’ position is set out in the c losing submissions: 

8\. The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff had given his c onsent for the Bank Monies to be distributed equally among the Dec eased’s 6 c hildren ac c ording to the Letter of Wishes and he is bound by that c onsent under the applic able Muslim law. 

9\. The Defendants’ position is that the Plaintiff gave his c onsent to take a 1/6 share of the     Bank Monies in issue, not at a single point in time, but over a period of time, beginning on 18 May 2003 (when the Letter of Wishes was found and read), through to 19 May 2003 (when the     Dec eased’s Will was found and read and the Plaintiff did not objec t), through to the afternoon of 19 May 2003 (when the Plaintiff physic ally rec eived his share of the Bank Monies and did not objec t), and ending a few days after that ... 

**The critical events and developments** 

19     The major events to the distribution and the dispute are: 

 (a) 18 May 2003 – the disc overy of the letter of wishes, and the c hildren’s dec ision to c omply with it and distribute the money in the joint ac c ounts equally; 

 (b) 19 May 2003 – the disc overy of the will and the distribution of the money in the joint ac c ounts; and 

 (c ) 8 May 2006 – when c ounsel informed me on the first day of the hearing that any agreement to distribute c an only apply to two thirds of the moneys in the joint ac c ounts. The parties may have c ome to this c onc lusion earlier, but no earlier date was mentioned to me. There was no suggestion that any of the siblings was aware of that on 18 or 19 May 2003. 

**Whether the distribution was made with the plaintiff’s agreement** 

20     The plaintiff’s evidenc e was that all the c hildren “dec ided” (the word he used in distinc tion to “agreed”) to c omply with the letter of wishes. 

21     The plaintiff maintained that he had not given his informed c onsent to the distribution even though he c onc eded that he knew at that time that the distribution was not in ac c ordanc e to Muslim law under whic h a male c hild would rec eive twic e as muc h as a female c hild. He also alleged that he thought the letter of wishes was binding on him, although this was not stated in his affidavit or opening statement. 

22     A lot of effort was put in by Dr Raman and Mr Namazie, c ounsel for the plaintiff and defendants respec tively, to show or to refute the existenc e of an agreement. I will not rec ite the arguments put before me. It suffic es for me to state that I find on the evidenc e that the distribution of 19 May was made with the plaintiff’s agreement and c onsent, _ie_ , that he agreed on 18 May to c omply with the dec eased’s wish that the money be distributed equally between the siblings with the knowledge that the wish was not in c onformity with Muslim law, and he had not done that in the mistaken belief that the letter of wishes was binding on him. 

23     That finding, however, does not dispose of the matter. Another issue was to be addressed, 

 [note: 10] 

 [note: 11] 

 [note: 12] 


_ie_ , is the agreement suffic ient? It is c ommon ground that the dec eased’s wish c annot be c arried out even with the siblings’ agreement bec ause one third of the money in the joint ac c ounts had been disposed of under the will to the dec eased’s grandc hildren and some other persons. 

24     In other words, there c annot be a valid agreement under Muslim law to c omply with the dec eased’s wishes exc ept by limiting the sc ope of the equal distribution. This is the c ause for the restatement of the issue at the c ommenc ement of the hearing. Against the restated issue, the defenc e has to be that there is an agreement to distribute two thirds of that money equally between the siblings. 

25     Here the defenc e runs into two diffic ulties: 

 (a) there was no agreement on the distribution of two thirds of the money in the joint ac c ounts; and 

 (b) the agreement relied on by the defenc e was for the distribution of all the money in the joint ac c ounts. 

**Review of the case** 

26     On the defenc e’s evidenc e, the siblings agreed on 18 May 2003 to c omply with the letter of wishes and ac c epted the equal distribution of all the money made on the next day. However the wish c annot be c arried out in full even if the siblings had agreed to it, and any agreement must be limited to two thirds of the money. 

27     The question then is whether the agreement to distribute all the money in the joint ac c ounts equally is the same as an agreement to distribute two thirds of the money in the joint ac c ounts equally. 

28     The answer must be no. Inasmuc h as all the money is not synonymous to two thirds of the money, an agreement to distribute all the money is not an agreement to distribute two thirds of the money. If one of the siblings had said on 18 May: “Although the letter of wishes says ‘all my c ash balanc e’ let us c hange that to ‘two thirds of the c ash balanc e’ instead”, someone might have disagreed on the ground that that was not what the dec eased had wished, or on the ground that he was not prepared to have his share reduc ed again after the _corpus_ had been reduc ed. In fac t at that time no one had thought of reduc ing the amount to be distributed. 

29     In the event, although the plaintiff had agreed to the equal distribution of all the money in the joint ac c ounts, he had not agreed to the equal distribution of two thirds of that money. 

30     Sinc e the defendants c annot rely on the agreement of 18 and 19 May to insist that two thirds of the money in the joint ac c ounts be distributed equally between the siblings, the issue must be answered in the negative. The money in the joint ac c ounts should be distributed in ac c ordanc e to Muslim law.
