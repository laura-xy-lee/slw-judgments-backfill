## JUDGMENT: 

**SUPPLEMENTAL JUDGMENT** 

1\. After delivery of my Judgment dated 29 February 2000 and pursuant to my direc tion therein, c ounsel for the plaintiffs and the first defendant presented further arguments before me on the question of c osts. As I indic ated I would, I now finalise my orders for c osts as between New Civilbuild (the plaintiffs) and Guobena (the first defendants). 

2\. Counsel for Civilbuild quite naturally submitted that c osts should be awarded to his c lients as they had suc c eeded in obtaining final judgment on their c laim for progress payments and retention monies totalling $1,813,981.95. Guobena on the other hand, had failed in its c laim for liquidated damages and had only been awarded interloc utory judgment on their c laim for advanc es made to New Civilbuild, whic h c laim had yet to be assessed; therefore, Guobena should pay the c osts of the ac tion. 

3\. Counsel for New Civilbuild had also inquired whether there was an inc onsistenc y between paras 71 and 100 of my Judgment. To rec apitulate, in para 71, I had pointed out that neither New Civilbuild nor Guobena had filed a defenc e to Tai Ping’s c ounterc laim; I should have made it c lear that it was c ounsel for Tai Ping who c anvassed this argument at the hearing of an earlier interloc utory applic ation 

- that New Civilbuild and Guobena were deemed to have admitted to Tai Ping’s c ounterc laim as a matter of proc edure. I should also have added that c ounsel for Guobena disagreed and rightly so, that there was any requirement under the Rules of Court, for a defendant to plead to the c ase of a c o- defendant in the same suit. Consequently, there was no c onflic t between para 71 and para 100 of my Judgment where I held that Tai Ping had failed in its c ounterc laim against Guobena. 

4\. Finally, c ounsel asked for the refund of the sec urity for c osts ($15,000) furnished by New Civilbuild in favour of Goubena, on the direc tion of the Registrar. I had refused to inc rease the amount of sec urity when Guobena applied for the same on 28 June 1999. 

5\. Counsel for Guobena took a different approac h on the issue of c osts. In his written submissions, he used a ‘sc oreboard’ method based on the number (8) of issues I had identified in my judgment (see para 12); in the proc ess he arrived at a sc ore of 6 wins for Guobena and 2 for New Civilbuild. Consequently, c ounsel argued, Guobena should be awarded c osts against New Civilbuild for the ac tion. In addition, c ounsel applied for a c ertific ate for two (2) c ounsel and submitted that the previous order for c osts I made (on 28 June 1999) in favour of New Civilbuild for amendments to the defenc e should be reversed in his c lients’ favour; I rejec ted both requests as being without merit. 

6\. I shall first give my reasons for rejec ting c ounsel’s requests. Granted, there is provision under O 59 


r 19 of the Rules of Court 1997 to award c osts to a party for more than one c ounsel for both gettingup as well as for c ourt attendanc e. There are however no set rules as to when and how the c ourt should exerc ise its disc retion under that provision. I personally am of the view that a c ourt should award a c ertific ate for two (2) c ounsel as an exc eption to the general rule that only one c ounsel should be awarded c osts. Suc h exc eptional c irc umstanc es would inc lude c ases whic h involve a high degree of c omplexity of fac ts and or law or, where there are many issues of both fac t and law and, trial is lengthy. Henc e, in England it is not unc ommon for the c ourts to award c ertific ate for not only two but three c ounsel, in infringement of trademark and patent c ases. 

7\. Undoubtedly, trial in this c ase was spread over 15 days in two (2) tranc hes with an interval of four (4) months in between. However, that fac tor alone does not warrant a suc c essful litigant being awarded a c ertific ate for two (2) c ounsel. He will be adequately c ompensated by way of refresher for the break in the two portions of the trial as well as for the length of the trial, by the taxing registrar. Counsel for Guobena had submitted that the fac t all parties were represented by two (2) c ounsel eac h was indic ative of how diffic ult the proc eedings were. With respec t, I disagree. The submission is in any c ase inac c urate as there was only one c ounsel for New Civilbuild throughout the proc eedings. As for Guobena and Tai Ping, I am of the view they had two (2) c ounsel eac h by c hoic e and not nec essity. The fac t that I identified eight (8) issues does not mean that there were c omplex legal issues involved or that the fac ts were c onvoluted. The doc umentation was indeed voluminous but that is to be expec ted of any c onstruc tion c ase espec ially one where both liability and quantum were disputed. Again this fac tor will be taken into c onsideration in the taxation proc ess. I am also of the view that a test for the applic ability of O 59 r 19 must be whether it was reasonable of the defendants in this c ase to appoint two instead of, one c ounsel; I think it was not. 

8\. As for Guobena’s argument on reversing my previous order for c osts in favour of New Civilbuild, this submission was no longer open to them as they c ould have but failed to, appeal within the time stipulated under the Rules of Court. Further, it would be a departure from the norm if I were to award c osts in any event to instead of against, a party applying for amendments at the very late stage whic h Guobena did, in the midst of trial. Consequently, the sum of $5,000 whic h I awarded to New Civilbuild pending taxation of their c osts for those amendments (and presently held by Guobena’s c ounsel as stakeholder) should forthwith be released to their c ounsel. 

9\. I turn now to the main issue of c osts. One other argument put forth by c ounsel for Guobena was, that it c ould not be said that New Civilbuild had suc c eeded in their c laim for progress payments on the merits as that was a c onc ession by his c lients right from the start. That is c orrec t from the point of view of Guobena’s pleadings but that c onc ession did not extend to allowing New Civilbuild to obtain final judgment against the first defendants but with a stay of exec ution pending the outc ome of Guobena’s c ounterc laim. Indeed, Guobena applied to set aside New Civilbuild’s ex-parte injunc tion by relying on their c ounterc laim. Therefore the c onc ession did not save the c ourt’s time or the parties’ c osts. As for the retention monies, no c onc ession at all was made by Guobena. 

10\. What is c lear is that New Civilbuild suc c eeded in obtaining final judgment on two (2) out of the three (3) c laims pleaded in their statement of c laim; I had disallowed their c laim in exc ess of $2m for c osts inc urred for variations works and for damages resulting from delay in c ompletion whic h I held was largely due to their own fault. 

11     As for Guobena, I had dismissed their c laim for liquidated damages whic h (after amendment) was reduc ed to $3m from $6,180,000. Consequently, based on the partic ulars in para 29 of Guobena’s defenc e, what remains of their c ounterc laim against New Civilbuild (when assessed) would at most, amount to $270,913, after taking into ac c ount (whic h they must and have) the sum rec eived from Tai Ping under the bond. 


12\. I had in para 97 of my Judgment, already reserved to the Registrar the question of c osts on assessment of the damages pursuant to the interloc utory judgements awarded to New Civilbuild and Guobena on their respec tive c laim and c ounterc laim. Consequently the ‘sc oreboard’ as it stands, using the methodology adopted by c ounsel for Guobena, is that New Civilbuild have obtained final judgement (and interloc utory judgment) in sums whic h exc eed and would likely exc eed what was awarded to Guobena. In these c irc umstanc es, I am of the view for expedienc y, that there should be a global order for c osts in that New Civilbuild be given c osts of the ac tion but with ƒ reduc tion to take into ac c ount Guobena’s suc c essful c ounterc laim, but with full disbursements up to judgment. Conversely, Guobena are entitled to be reimbursed by New Civilbuild their full disbursements on a standard basis, up to and inc luding judgment. 

13\. Further, the sum of $15,000 paid into c ourt by New Civilbuild as sec urity for Guobena’s c osts c annot be withdrawn until the c onc lusion of the Registrar’s assessment of damages. For the avoidanc e of further dispute between the parties, New Civilbuild are not entitled to rec eive and Guobena are not obliged to pay, the judgment sum of $1,813,981.95 pending the assessment. However, to ensure that New Civilbuild are not prejudic ed by any delay in the assessment proc ess, I award them interest at 6% on the said sum from date of writ (14 January 1998) until judgment ( February 2000). 

14\. Finally, as I had not antic ipated this undue delay between release of my Judgement and the hearing on c osts, I am resc inding my previous direc tion dated 28 November that for purposes of appeal, time runs from 29 February 2000. Instead, for purposes of appeal on the question of liability only, time runs from the date of this Supplemental Judgment.
