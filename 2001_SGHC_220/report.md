: This is an applic ation by the applic ant Beaufort Sentosa Development Pte Ltd (`the applic ant`) for an order approving its proposed reduc tion of share c apital under s 73 of the Companies Ac t (Cap 50, 1994 Ed) (`the Ac t`). This applic ation is unusual only bec ause the reduc tion sought involved the c anc ellation of the entire 149,500 preferenc e shares of $100 eac h and the repayment of that sum to the shareholders. 

Ordinarily, preferenc e shares may be redeemed under s 70 of the Ac t. Suc h a redemption may only be made out of profits or proc eeds from the issue of fresh shares made for the purposes of the redemption. 

The applic ant, however, does not have suffic ient profits to redeem its preferenc e shares under s 70 and propose to extinguish those shares by c apital reduc tion under s 73. The applic ation sought the c anc ellation of the shares and the repayment of the value to the shareholders thereby reduc ing the c apital as well as c anc elling the shares. 

To this end, a spec ial resolution in the following terms were passed at a meeting of the c ompany on 5 May 2001: 

 That the capital of the Company, now consisting of S$57,344,800.00 divided into 45,050,000 ordinary shares of S$1.00 each, and 149,500 preference shares of [S]$100.00 each, all of which have been issued and are fully paid, be reduced to 45,050,000 divided into 45,050,000 ordinary shares of S$1.00 each by cancelling and/or extinguishing the paid up capital to the full extent of S$100.00 upon each of the 149,500 preference shares of S$100.00 each and repaying to the holders of those preference shares the sum of S$100.00 per share. 

There are four shareholders of the applic ant, namely, Beaufort Holdings Ltd, Zayuc el Ltd, Redbridge Ltd and Beauwin Singapore Pte Ltd. This applic ation was made as part of the applic ant`s share restruc turing exerc ise. Artic le 10(3) of the applic ant`s artic les of assoc iation provides that the preferenc e shares `shall be redeemable on and subjec t to and in ac c ordanc e with the provisions of the Ac t`. 

The internal requirements of the applic ant had been c omplied with, inc luding art 67(2) of the applic ant`s artic les of assoc iation whic h requires the c onsent of the Sentosa Development Corp. That c onsent had been duly obtained and exhibited in the affidavit of Cheung Tseung Ming as `CTM-4`. 


The preferenc e shares in question were due for redemption 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001 in various tranc hes. These dates passed but the shares c ould not be redeemed bec ause the applic ant did not have suffic ient profits. 

The only issue whic h needed some c onsideration was whether this c ourt is empowered to sanc tion the applic ation to reduc e the applic ant`s share c apital by c anc elling the preferenc e shares. Mr Tan appearing on behalf of the applic ant in this applic ation, made by way of an ex parte originating summons, was unable to produc e any loc al authority save a textbook c ommentary by Walter Woon in his sec ond edition of **_Company Law_** in whic h the author stated: 

 If it is desired to reduce the capital redemption reserve in any other way, the proper procedure for capital reduction will have to be followed. For instance, instead of redeeming the preference shares, a company may choose to reduce its capital by paying off the preference shareholders. This will be subject to the normal rules relating to reduction of capital under s 73. 

The sixth edition of **_Ford`s Principles of Corporations Law_** rec ited a similar sentiment (at para 831) and referred to **Re Holders Investment Trust** [1971] 2 All ER 289[1971] 1 WLR 583 as authority for the proposition. However, that c ase is obliquely relevant in the sense that although Megarry J appears to ac c ept the princ iple that the c ompany may redeem its preferenc e shares by means of a simple reduc tion of c apital, he nonetheless refused the applic ation bec ause on the fac ts before him he was not satisfied that the supporting trustees voted for the reduc tion in the bona fide belief that they were ac ting in the interests of the general body of members of that c lass. The requisite sanc tion passed by them was therefore held to be ineffec tual. 

In the Australian c ase of **Re Birkenshaw Holdings** [1975] 10 SASR 577, Zelling J in a short judgment held that: 

 notwithstanding the careful provision for the replacement of capital contained in s 61 [our s 70] by payment out of a capital redemption reserve account, a court can in a proper case apply the provisions of s 64 [our s 73] and approve a reduction of capital where the reduction consists in the repayment of redeemable preference shares. 

This dec ision met with approval by Messrs Paterson & Ednie the editors of **_Australian Company Law_** 

. The **_Birkenshaw_** approac h was rejec ted by Needham J in another Australian c ase, namely, **Re Steel Improvement Holdings** [1980] NSWLR 569. The judge said, at p 572: 

 In my opinion, s 61(3) is mandatory and is a special provision, as distinct from the general provisions of s 64. One could perhaps test the validity of a conclusion that, despite s 61(3)(a), redeemable preference shares may be redeemed out of capital without the issue of new shares, by asking whether the court, under s 64, could confirm a resolution reducing capital by the redemption of redeemable preference shares which were not fully paid up. The answer must be a firm negative. 

Subsequently, in **Re Morganite Australia** [1989] NSWLR 343, Mc Lelland J noted the c onflic ting Australian dec isions and dec ided to follow **_Re Birkenshaw Holdings_** (supra). He referred to s 120(3) 


and s 123 of the New South Wales Code, whic h are the equivalent of our s 70 and s 73 respec tively, and said that: 

 ... it seems to me, as a matter of construction of the Code, that the expression "redeemed" in s 120(3) means redeemed pursuant to the liability to redemption included as a term of the issue, pursuant to the power to issue preference shares having such a term, conferred on a company by s 120(1). In other words it refers only to a contractual redemption which can be effected by virtue of s 120 without any confirmation by the Court. 

 I find it difficult to understand, as a matter of policy, why the legislature would exclude from the general provisions of s 123, permitting a reduction of capital subject to confirmation by the Court, a particular case where the reduction was to effect a cancellation of cumulative preference shares. In my opinion there is no reason why such a reduction should not be held to fall within the general terms of s 123. Having regard to what I regard as the limited meaning of the word "redeemed" in s 120(3) there is no reason to regard that subsection as imposing some blanket prohibition which prevents the Court from acting under s 123, where the practical effect of the reduction of capital would be equivalent to a contractual redemption of preference shares. 

Mr Tan also referred me to the English c ase of **Re Saltdean Estate Co** [1968] 3 All ER 829 in whic h Buc kley J approved a petition to reduc e the c ompany`s share c apital by extinguishment of preferred shares notwithstanding opposition to the petition by the preferred shareholders. The judge there was of the view that the proposed reduc tion of c apital was not unfair bec ause the preferred shareholders were always at risk that their right to partic ipate in profits might at any time be frustrated by a liquidation or a reduc tion of c apital properly resolved on by a suffic ient majority of the members of the c ompany. For my part, I am not in full agreement with the view that the preferenc e shareholders were not dealt with unfairly bec ause they must have known from the outset that they may never get to share the profits. I differ in my view bec ause I believe that the premise and the c onc lusion may not have been suffic iently bridged. It might have been justifiable in the spec ific instanc e before Buc kley J but I would be slow to ac c ept it as a general princ iple. That issue, however, was not before me bec ause all relevant parties in the present c ase save the trade c reditors support the applic ation for c apital reduc tion in the manner proposed. The weight of the authorities in the UK as well as in Australia seem to lean in favour of rec ognising the right of the c ompany to reduc e its share c apital by extinguishment of preferred shares provided, of c ourse, that the c reditors are not prejudic ed. And further, in my view, there must be no reasonable objec tion from the preferred shareholders themselves. I ac c ept the c apital reduc tion by c anc ellation of preferred shares as a c ommerc ially expedient method of managing a c ompany`s c apital and debt. All the nec essary c onditions have been c omplied with in the present applic ation before me. So, in these c irc umstanc es, and as was done in **Re A Lesser & Co** [1929] VLR 316, I dispensed with the advertisement of the presentation of this petition as well as the settlement of the list of c reditors, and granted an order in terms of the applic ation. 

## Outcome: 

Applic ation allowed.
