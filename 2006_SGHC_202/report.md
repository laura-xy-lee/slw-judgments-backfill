**Choo Han Teck J:** 

1       The applic ant in this motion (“the applic ant”) was c harged with two other persons, one Mr Yap Keng Ho (“Mr Yap”) and one Mr Ghandi Abalam (“Mr Ghandi”) under s 19(1)( _a_ ) of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Ac t, (Cap 257, 2001 Rev Ed) for c arrying out public entertainment without a lic enc e. Mr Yap and Mr Ghandi were respec tively the applic ants in Criminal Motion No 29 of 2006 (“CM 29/2006”) and Criminal Motion No 31 of 2006 (“CM 31/2006”). CM 31/2006 was heard together with the present applic ation, _ie_ , Criminal Motion No 30 of 2006 (“CM 30/2006”). Mr Yap’s applic ation in CM 29/2006 was heard and dismissed by me on 30 Oc tober 2006. All three applic ations c onc erned events whic h had oc c urred during the trial of the three ac c used persons, _ie_ , the respec tive applic ants in CM 29/2006, 30/2006, and 31/2006, whic h c ommenc ed in the Distric t Court on 25 Oc tober 2006. The applic ant filed the present c riminal motion for an order dec laring a “mistrial”. The applic ation also made three other c laims, namely, that: (a) there had been a violation of Arts 9(1)–9(3), 12 and 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the Constitution”); (b) the AttorneyGeneral had misled the c ourt and violated Arts 9 and 12 of the Constitution; and (c ) the “State Counc il” should be direc ted to advise the President of Singapore to “c onvene a Constitutional Court under Artic le 100 of the Constitution”. The text of the present applic ation was identic al to that in CM 29/2006 and 31/2006. The differenc e in the two applic ations before me on 31 Oc tober 2006, _ie_ , CM 30/2006 and 31/2006, and that on 30 Oc tober 2006, _ie_ , CM 29/2006, was that the two present applic ations were filed without the support of any affidavit. 

2       The fac tual basis of this applic ation, as stated in the first paragraph of the motion, c onc erned the presenc e of the investigating offic er in c ourt during the rec ording of the oral evidenc e of three witnesses. The applic ant here (as well as Mr Ghandi in CM 31/2006), asked for time to file his affidavit in support, dec laring in the c ourse of his submission, that his c ase was different from that of Mr Yap, the applic ant in CM 29/2006. The applic ant submitted that there was no need to have the affidavit filed in a hurry and that I c ould order it to be filed _after_ the trial in the Distric t Court. 

3       Whilst I rec ognised that the possibility of the applic ant making different submissions from those made by Mr Yap in CM 29/2006, the applic ation was so ostensibly flawed that it had to be dismissed _in limine_. I need not repeat the reasons I gave in CM 29/2006 in full, save to say that where an applic ant has ac c ess to the appeal proc ess, as the applic ant here does, it will often be an 


abuse of the proc ess of c ourt to apply by way of a c riminal motion asking the High Court to exerc ise its revisionary powers. Furthermore, the applic ant’s request that he be allowed to file his affidavit after the trial emphasised the futility of this motion. If he c ould wait till the end of the trial, then he c ould also have waited to present his c omplaint by way of an appeal, if it were still relevant, after all, the trial judge might ultimately have ruled in his favour. 

4       The applic ant expressed his dismay that his applic ation before me was dismissed “without being heard”. He seemed to have overlooked the c lear and loud oral submission that he made before me, as part of whic h he c laimed that the trial below was “a moc kery” bec ause the trial judge was biased, and asked for a fair trial. I heard more than that. I heard the applic ant’s grievanc es of a politic al nature, but I have ignored all of them, save now to say that no one ought to make submissions on matters that have no relevanc e to the legal issues at hand. No one ought to use c ourt proc eedings to raise extraneous matters whic h are better addressed in a different forum and to a different audienc e. The legal proc ess should not be suspended for the personal benefit of any individual unless the law itself permits. Whether it so permits is a question of law that must be determined by the c ourt, and not by the individual who seeks that dec laration. One of the most important princ iples of fairness in a trial is that no judgment should be passed until the trial has been c ompleted. We generally c onc eive of this princ iple as applying to the trial judge’s determination of the merits of the litigants’ c ases. The present motion before me made me think that it is time to issue a reminder that this princ iple applies also to persons sitting in judgment _over_ the trial judge’s c onduc t of the proc eedings. No one ought to judge any of his rulings until the trial is over. The proper proc edure in this c ase was for the applic ant to take his c ase on appeal in ac c ordanc e with the rules and law of appeals. Unfortunately, that was not done. 

5       This applic ation, as were the applic ations in CM 29/2006 and 31/2006, was thus utterly misc onc eived, leaving me with no option but to dismiss it.
