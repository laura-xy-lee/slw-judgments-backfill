_Contract_ 

23 May 2011 

**Kan Ting Chiu J:** 

1       The issue in this matter is whether the parties in these divorc e proc eedings had agreed between themselves to vary the orders on the division of two properties whic h were their matrimonial assets. 

2       The plaintiff Ng Irene was the wife (“the wife”), and the defendant Tan Meng Heng Robin was the husband (“the husband”). 

3       In the c ourse of the divorc e proc eedings, an order was made by Justic e Woo Bih Li on 9 February 2010 that: 

 The Plaintiff is to transfer her interest in 14 Stratton Walk, Singapore 806765 [“the Stratton Walk property”] to the Defendant provided that the Defendant is to refund the Plaintiff’s CPF c ontribution with ac c rued interest towards the purc hase of the said property. 

 The Defendant is to transfer his interest in 511 Yio Chu Kang Road, #01-04, The Calrose, Singapore 787066 [“the Calrose property”] to the Plaintiff and the Defendant is to pay off the entire outstanding housing loan thereon as well as to refund the Plaintiff and his own CPF c ontributions with ac c rued interest towards the purc hase of the said property. 

 ... 

 The transfers of the two properties are to be done simultaneously and within five (5) months from the date of this Order or suc h other extended date as the parties may agree to. 

The effec t of the order was that the husband was to have the Stratton Walk property and the wife was to have the Calrose property, and that the transfers were to take plac e within five months (by 9 July 2010). 

4       The parties did not transfer the properties after the order was made. Instead, they engaged in an exc hange of c orrespondenc e referred to in the next few paragraphs.

5       On 14 April 2010 the husband’s solic itors wrote and informed the wife’s solic itors that: 

 We have our c lient’s latest instruc tions: 

 to propose to vary the Order of Court dated 9 th February 2010 to provide for the sale and/or a transfer of No.14 Stratton Walk to your c lient’s name wholly, whilst our c lient takes sole ownership of #01-04, The Calrose. 

 ... 

 Please therefore revert to us within the next three (3) days from the date hereof so that we can do the needful on the conveyance of the two matrimonial properties. 

 [emphasis added] 

6       On 19 April 2010 the husband’s solic itors sent a reminder to the wife’s solic itors requesting them to “revert as soon as possible on the ‘swapping’ of properties under the Order of Court”. 

7       On 20 April 2010 the wife’s solic itors responded to the letter of 14 April 2010, stating: 

 We regret to inform you that after muc h c onsideration, our c lient is not agreeable to your c lient’s proposal. We are instruc ted that she will abide by the Order as it stands. 

8       The husband did not give up on his proposal. On 21 April 2010 his solic itors wrote to the wife’s solic itors, stating: 

 [W]e would urge your c lient to re-c onsider seriously to ‘swap’ the 2 properties; failing whic h we will still proc eed with our separate applic ation to Court to vary the Order of Court dated 9 th February 2010. 

 We shall seek an extension of time from the Courts to attend to the c onveyanc ing matters. 

There was no request for a reply in three days. 

9       On 3 June 2010 the wife’s solic itors replied that she agreed to and ac c epted the proposed swap. Quite inexplic ably and regrettably, both c ounsel did not see it fit to exhibit this letter in the parties’ affidavits. However, this letter was referred to in the wife’s solic itors’ letter of 25 August 2010 and also in the husband’s written submissions, and its existenc e was not disputed. 

10     On 25 August 2010 the wife’s solic itors wrote to the husband’s solic itors, stating: 

 You will rec all that your c lient had requested for a swap of properties vide your letters to us dated 21 April 2010 and 14 April 2010 i.e. that our c lient was to take the Stratton Walk property in plac e of the Calrose property and your c lient would take the Calrose property in plac e of the Stratton Walk property. By our letter of 3 June 2010, we had on our c lient’s instruc tions agreed to and ac c epted the requested swap. 

 As you know, the Order provided that the transfers of the properties were to be effec ted within 5 months from the date of the said order. It is now more than 5 months and we have as yet to rec eive the transfer doc uments from your c lient to enable our c lient to transfer all her share interest and estate in the Calrose apartment to your c lient and for your c lient to 


 transfer all his share interest and estate in the Stratton Walk property to our c lient. 

11     The letter of 25 August 2010 did not bring any satisfac tion to the wife, and on 16 September 2010, she filed the present applic ation to vary the Order of Court of 9 February 2010 to give effec t to the swap. 

12     In her affidavit filed in support of the applic ation the wife exhibited the letters referred to in [5] t o [8] _supra_. She stated that after she had ac c epted the husband’s swap offer by the letter of 3 June 2010 the husband ‘did nothing’, and her solic itors had to follow up with the letter of 25 August 

2010\. (The husband’s inac tion will be c onsidered later.) 

13     The husband opposed the applic ation. In his affidavit filed on 28 September 2010, he gave the reasons for his objec tion. He deposed at [4] that: 

 The reason is that I am in the c ourse of c omplianc e with the said Order in respec t of the transfer of the property known as No.14 Stratton Walk, Singapore 806765 (hereinafter referred to as ‘The Stratton’) to my sole name and transfer of the property known as 511 Yio Chu Kang Road, #0104, The Calrose, Singapore 787066 (hereinafter referred to as ‘The Calrose’) to the Plaintiff solely. 

and added at [8]: 

 However, by my solic itor’s said letter dated 14 th [April] 2010, it was c learly stated that I wanted a response from the Plaintiff in 3 day’s time whether my proposal was agreeable to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s solic itor’s replied on 20th April 2010 telling us that the Plaintiff is not in agreement to my proposal to swap properties. However, the Plaintiff c hanged her mind and c hose to revert t o us only on 3rd June 2010 that she would ac c ept the ‘swap’ of the properties; that is to say that she would take over The Stratton whilst I would take over The Calrose. I say now that I am not obliged to let the Plaintiff have The Stratton. 

In the written submissions dated 8 November 2010, the husband’s solic itors argued that when the wife ac c epted the offer on 3 June 2010 it was 50 days after the offer of 14 April 2010 whic h was open for only three days. The princ ipal, if not sole basis, of the defendant’s c ase was that the offer to swap had lapsed by the time the wife ac c epted it. 

14     The husband’s solic itors should not rely on the letter of 14 April 2010 in isolation. That letter was followed by the letters of 19 April 2010 and 21 April 2010 where the husband persuaded the wife to agree to the swap proposal. It was wrong in law and in fac t to argue that the offer had lapsed when it was not ac c epted within three days from 14 April 2010. Clearly the husband had extended his offer in the subsequent letters and abandoned the 17 April 2010 deadline. 

15     I would add that the referenc e to the three days in the letter of 14 April 2010 is open to a different c onstruc tion, whic h is more c onsistent with the c ontents of the letter, that the writers asked for a reply in three days to allow time to arrange the transfers, and not that the offer was to lapse after three days. It should be noted that the letter was written by lawyers. If they had wanted to inform the wife that the offer was open for three days, one would expec t them to state that in c lear terms. 

16     The husband’s c onduc t showed that he did not c onsider the offer to have lapsed by 17 April 

2010\. He did not dispute that when the wife’s evidenc e that she ac c epted the offer on 3 June 2010, he did nothing. If he thought that that offer had lapsed, and was no longer open for ac c eptanc e, the most natural thing for him to do would be to tell her that the offer had lapsed, and that he no longer 


wished to swap the properties, and to ask her to proc eed with the transfers in ac c ordanc e with the Order of Court. Instead, he did nothing, and the wife’s solic itors had to send the reminder of 25 August 2010. 

17     The husband only responded after the wife filed on 16 September 2010 the present applic ation to amend the Order of Court. In his affidavit filed on 28 September 2010 he said in [8]: 

 I say now that I am not obliged to let the Plaintiff have The Stratton. [emphasis added] 

It is signific ant that he did not say that the offer had lapsed, when it lapsed, or that he had informed the wife that that offer had lapsed. 

18     The husband deposed a sec ond affidavit on 4 November 2010 in whic h he exhibited a letter dated 27 Oc tober 2010 to the wife’s solic itors. In this letter the husband’s solic itors wrote: 

 In c omplianc e with the Order of Court dated 9th February 2010, we now forward herewith the nec essary c onveyanc ing doc uments for your c lient to exec ute on the pages tagged. 

 Please sign and return the doc uments to us within seven (7) days from the date hereof so that we have suffic ient time to let OCBC the mortgagee bank sign. Thereafter, the loan c an be disbursed within (7) seven days of the Bank’s exec ution. 

 Your c lient shall have The Calrose free of enc umbranc es and your c lient shall have a full refund of her CPF’s monies with ac c rued interest utilised for No.14 Stratton Walk and The Calrose after the TRANSFER doc uments on the 2 said matrimonial properties are duly exec uted and registered. 

 Kindly advise your c lient to render her full c o-operation on the c onveyanc ing matter. 

19     This was a c urious letter. The writers were aware that there was a pending applic ation to vary the Order of Court of 2 February 2010, nevertheless they sought the wife’s “full c o-operation on the c onveyanc ing matter”. It is inexplic able that even at this stage, the solic itors did not inform the wife’s solic itors that the swap offer had lapsed before it was ac c epted if that was the husband’s position at that time. (That position was only stated on 9 November 2010 in the written submissions.) 

20     I find that the husband had not withdrawn his offer on or before 3 June 2010. The question is whether the husband’s offer to swap the properties was open when the wife ac c epted it. 

21     The rights of the parties c an be asc ertained from the following fac ts: 

 (a) under the Order of Court of 9 February 2010 the husband was to have the Stratton Walk property and the wife was to have the Carlose property; 

 (b) the husband made the initial offer to swap on 14 April 2010, whic h ac c ording to him was expressed to be open for three days; 

 (c ) the offer was extended on 19 April 2010 and 21 April 2010 without the three-day limitation; 

 (d) the offer was ac c epted on 3 June 2010; and 

 (e) the husband stated his rejec tion of the ac c eptanc e in his affidavit of 28 September 2010. 


22     When the swap offer was extended without the three-day response period, there is no legal basis to read that c ondition into the subsequent offers. In the c irc umstanc es, the offer was open for ac c eptanc e until it is withdrawn by the husband, or is deemed to have lapsed after a reasonable time. 

23     What is a ‘reasonable time’ on the fac ts? Three fac tors are relevant: 

 (a) the 9 July 2010 deadline in the Order of Court for the transfer of the properties; 

 (b) the importanc e of the property swap to the wife; and 

 (c ) the husband’s response to the wife’s ac c eptanc e of the offer. 

24     It would be reasonable to deem the offer to have lapsed if it was not ac c epted by 9 July 2010 as the husband was entitled to proc eed with the implementation of the terms of the Order of Court. It would also be reasonable to allow adequate time to the wife to c onsider the offer c arefully as the two properties were the entirety of the matrimonial assets to be divided following the divorc e (see the letter of 21 April 2010 and the advic e to the wife to c onsider the swap seriously). Against this bac kground, the response on 3 June 2010 c annot be said to be unreasonably delayed. The husband’s delayed response to the ac c eptanc e indic ated that he had not c onsidered the offer to have lapsed when he rec eived the ac c eptanc e of 3 June 2010. 

25     For the reasons stated, I found that the husband’s offer was open for ac c eptanc e when it was ac c epted by the wife, and I granted her applic ation to vary the Order of Court of 9 February 2010 to give effec t to the proposed swap that she ac c epted.
