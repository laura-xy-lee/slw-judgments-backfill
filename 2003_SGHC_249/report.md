1       The appellant was c onvic ted of one c harge under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and was sentenc ed to a term of imprisonment of four months. She appealed against her c onvic tion. I dismissed her appeal against c onvic tion and I now give my reasons. 

**Background** 

2       The appellant was a 48 year-old woman who c laimed trial to the following c harge: 

 Yo u, P o h Sa i... a re cha rge d tha t yo u o n the 22n d da y o f Ja nua ry 2003, a t o r a bo ut 1.00 p.m., a t P rime s upe rma rke t lo ca te d a t Blk 678, Wo o dla nds Ave 6, #01-716, Singa po re , a pla ce us e d fo r cus to dy o f pro pe rty, did co mmit the ft o f the fo llo w ing ite ms : a ) o ne pa cke t o f “Jin Hua ng” Tha i fra gra nt rice w hite rice va lue d a t $6.20/b) o ne pa cke t o f mince d po rk va lue d a t $2.55/c) o ne pa cke t o f lo in bo ne le s s me a t va lue d a t $2.60/a mo unting to a to ta l va lue o f $11.35, in the po s s e s s io n o f Micha e l Lo w o f the s a id P rime s upe rma rke t a nd ha ve the re by co mmitte d a n o ffe nce punis ha ble unde r Se ctio n 380 o f the P e na l C o de , C ha pte r 224 

3       At the trial below, the appellant did not deny that she had taken the three items. Instead, her defenc e foc used on c ontesting the mens rea of the offenc e: she denied intending to take the items without paying. The issue of her mens rea turned on two points of evidenc e: the loc ation at whic h she was detained and ac c used of shoplifting; and her behaviour before and after being detained. I now turn to the evidenc e adduc ed at the trial below. 

**Prosecution’s evidence** 

4       The prosec ution’s main witness was Tan Yang Liang (“Tan”), the sec urity guard at Prime supermarket (“the supermarket”). On 22 January 2003, at about 1pm, Tan was on duty at the supermarket. He was not wearing a uniform and was attired in shorts, slippers and a singlet. 

5       At that time, the supermarket was holding its Chinese New Year sale. As there was insuffic ient spac e inside the supermarket, some of the goods were plac ed outside the supermarket. Furthermore, as there were larger than normal c rowds of c ustomers frequenting the supermarket, an additional c ashier was plac ed outside the store. 

6       While on patrol, Tan spotted the appellant, who was holding a red plastic bag in her left 


hand, at the meat department. The plastic bag was not from the supermarket. He noted that she was ac ting suspic iously as she was “looking here and there and keeping an eye on the supermarket’s staff.” 

7       Tan saw the appellant take two pac kets of meat from the freezer and transfer them into one of the transparent plastic bags provided by the supermarket to c ustomers. The appellant c arried both bags in her left hand. She then walked over to the ric e sec tion and took a five kilo bag of ric e and likewise held it in her left hand. 

8       She then walked towards the bread sec tion whic h was loc ated just outside the supermarket next to the c ashier. She kept looking at the c ashier. She then moved behind the bread sec tion, turned abruptly and walked down a c orridor towards the loading bay behind the supermarket. 

9       Tan immediately c hased after her and stopped her about seven metres down the c orridor. He informed her that he was a sec urity guard employed by the supermarket. He told her that he had seen her taking the three items without paying and told her to follow him bac k to the offic e. The appellant told him that she was going to the bac k of the supermarket to look for her c hild in a c ar. 

10     Tan did not believe her story as he c ould see that there was no c ar parked at the loading bay. Instead, he brought the appellant bac k to the supermarket’s offic e. The appellant was very frightened and kept begging Tan to let her off. She told him that Chinese New Year was c oming and asked him not to make a polic e report. Tan told her that it was their c ompany’s polic y to hand over all shoplifters to the polic e. The appellant kept begging him and started c rying. 

11     Around this time, Low Wing Wah (“Low”), the supermarket’s manager, c ame into the offic e. Tan told him about the shoplifting inc ident and the appellant’s story about looking for her c hild. Low then walked to the loading bay to c hec k out the appellant’s story, but he did not see any c ar there. Upon his return, the appellant pleaded with Low to give her a sec ond c hanc e. Loh refused and the matter was reported to the polic e. 

12     Sergeant Tan Khim Huat was the first polic e offic er to arrive at the supermarket. Upon his arrival he met Low, Tan and the appellant. He proc eeded to take some photographs of the supermarket before referring the matter to the Investigating Offic er, Fu Peng Mun. After he had referred the c ase to the Investigating Offic er, he notic ed that the appellant was c rying. She asked him to give her a sec ond c hanc e and let her off. Sergeant Tan did not ac c ede to her request and esc orted the appellant bac k to the polic e station. 

**Defence’s evidence** 

13     The appellant was the only witness for the defenc e. She admitted that she had taken the three items and had left the supermarket and walked to the bread sec tion. After this point, her story diverged from the prosec ution’s. 

14     She stated that she had not paid for the three items as she had not finished shopping yet. She was looking to buy a pole with a hook. These poles were plac ed outside the supermarket behind the bread sec tion just next to a blue dustbin. She was looking at the poles when Tan approac hed her and asked her to go to the loading bay area. 

15     As Tan was dressed so c asually, she thought that he was a bad person and so she did not want to go with him. She thus walked to the c ashier instead. Tan followed her and told her to go with him to the offic e. 


16     The appellant denied c rying and asking Tan to give her a sec ond c hanc e. She also denied telling Tan that she was going to the bac k of the supermarket to look for her c hild in a c ar. She further denied begging Low and Sergeant Tan for a sec ond c hanc e and to be let off. Instead, she stated that she had only asked them to allow her to go home to c ollec t her laundry. 

**Decision of the court below** 

17     The distric t judge ac c epted Tan’s testimony as he had given “his evidenc e in a straightforward manner and was not disc redited on the material aspec ts of his evidenc e.” He noted that Tan had no reason to lie against the appellant who was a stranger to him. He thus rejec ted the appellant’s testimony. 

18     The distric t judge further noted that Tan, Low and Sergeant Tan had all testified that the appellant had asked them to give her a c hanc e and to let her off. He held that this c onstituted strong evidenc e against the appellant as there was no reason for all three of them to c onc oc t evidenc e against the appellant. He found that the route she took as well as her c onduc t in looking at the staff before leaving abruptly were behaviour c onsistent with that of a shoplifter looking around to c hec k that the c oast was c lear before taking the goods and making a quic k getaway. 

19     As suc h, the distric t judge held that the prosec ution had proved their c ase beyond a reasonable doubt and c onvic ted the appellant. He rejec ted her mitigation plea as c ontaining “nothing mitigating”, noted her three previous antec edents (all for shoplifting) and sentenc ed her to a term of imprisonment of four months. 

**The appeal** 

20     Before me, c ounsel for the appellant made two submissions. First, he c ontended that the distric t judge had erred in failing to apprec iate that the appellant’s c onduc t was inc onsistent with that of a shoplifter. This, he argued, was c lear bec ause she did not make any attempt to c onc eal the three items. Instead she was merely c arrying them openly in her left hand. 

21     This argument was patently unmeritorious. Even if I ac c epted that the appellant did not attempt to c onc eal the three items, this did not lead to the inferenc e that she did not intend to shoplift. The evidenc e showed that she was keeping a watc hful eye on the staff as she left the supermarket. Furthermore, given the c rowd there that day, it was only to be expec ted that none of the staff would be paying any partic ular attention to the appellant. Henc e, this was c learly not the c ase of a shoplifter surreptitiously taking some items and sneaking off. This was the c ase of a shoplifter taking some items and leaving amidst the c rowd. The modus operandi was different. Henc e, I found that it c ould not be said that her behaviour was inc onsistent with that of a shoplifter. 

22     Counsel for the appellant next argued that the prosec ution had failed to show that the appellant had left “the line of perc eived demarc ation between the area of business under the c ontrol of the supermarket and the area beyond that of the supermarket’s c ontrol.” This argument however flew in the fac e of the evidenc e before me. Tan’s evidenc e made it c lear that he detained the appellant about seven metres down the c orridor, and the c orridor led to the loading bay behind the supermarket. It was also c lear from the evidenc e that the supermarket had not plac ed either any goods or a c ashier anywhere on that c orridor. As suc h, I c ould not see how it c oould possibly be argued that the appellant had not passed this so c alled “line of perc eived demarc ation.” 

23     I would just add that the appellant had in her notic e of appeal stated that she was also appealing against sentenc e. However, c ounsel for the appellant did not address me on the matter. I 


took the opportunity to c larify the matter and he c onfirmed that the appellant was not appealing against the sentenc e as it c ould not be said that the sentenc e was manifestly exc essive. Having looked at the c irc umstanc es of the c ase and the appellant’s antec edents, I was in full agreement with c ounsel on this point. 

**Conclusion** 

24     In view of the arguments raised by c ounsel for the appellant and my c omments on these arguments above, it was c lear to my mind that there were no grounds whatsoever for allowing the appeal. As suc h, I dismissed the appeal against c onvic tion. 

_Appeal dismissed._
