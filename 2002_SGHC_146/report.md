## GROUNDS OF DECISION 

By this Originating Summons the plaintiffs are seeking under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap. 50) 

("the Act") leave of the court to bring an action ("the action") in the name of and on behalf of the 4th defendant, Far East-Hengw ell Pte Limited ("the Joint Venture Company"). The proposed action w ill seek to recover funds misappropriated by a substantial corporate shareholder of the Joint Venture Company, namely Far East Packaging Industrial Pte Limited ("Far East Packaging") and certain directors and officers appointed by Far East Packaging to manage and run the w holly ow ned subsidiary know n as Quanzhou Hengw ei Colour Printing & Exquisite Sack Co Ltd ("Quanzhou Hengw ei") of the Joint Venture Company in th e People’s Republic of China ("PRC"). The claims w ill include damages for breaches of contractual and/or fiduciary duties and for misrepresentation by the defendants and others and for reliefs against them as dishonest recipients. 

2       The proposed defendants have denied that there w as a misappropriation of the alleged sum of RMB 5,700,000 and the other claims asserted by the plaintiffs against them on behalf of the Joint Venture Company. They stress in rebuttal that the allegations are entirely w ithout basis. The first three defendants further assert that even the allegations made by the plaintiffs w ere taken as made out for present purposes, the application under s 216A of the Act is misconceived for the follow ing reason. They say that the Joint Venture Company has no locus standi and is not the appropriate party to commence the proposed action. Initially, they further contend that even if the Joint Venture Company is the party to bring any action the Liquidator of the Joint Venture Company w ould be the best person to have conduct of the proposed action. But this line of argument w as not relied on. I now turn to describe the parties and set out the material background and the applicable law. 

3       The plaintiffs and Far East Packaging are joint venture partners. They formed the Joint Venture Company on 26 March 1996. The sole business activity of the Joint Venture Company is its w holly ow ned subsidiary w hich I have referred to as Quanzhou Hengw ei. The purpose of the Joint Venture Company w as to acquire all the shares of Quanzhou Hengw ei. The plaintiffs ow n 2,550,000 shares of $1 each in the Joint Venture Company and Far East Packaging ow ns 2,450,000 shares; they therefore ow n 51% and 49% of 


the shares respectively. How ever, day to day management of factory operations of Quanzhou Hengw ei w as reserved under the joint venture to Far East Packaging. By clause 6.2 of the Joint Venture Agreement dated 27 March 1996 it w as agreed that the day to day management of Quanzhou Hengw ei w ould be carried out by the executive director and/or managers appointed by Far East and they shall be directed by Mr Thing Chiang Ching ("Mr CC Thing"), the first defendant. In the event, Far East Packaging appointed and authorised Mr CC Thing, one Mr Lim Seng Kw ee ("Mr Lim") and one Mr W u Yu Qin ("Mr W u") to manage the factory and business operations of Quanzhou Hengw ei. The three executives w ere said to have been directed by Mr CC Thing. 

**The background** 

4       On 31 May 2001 Far East Packaging commenced w inding up proceedings to w ind up the Joint Venture Company on a judgment debt w hich it had obtained. The plaintiffs looked into the matters and came to the conclusion that the Joint Venture Company had substantial cross claims against Far East Packaging w hich w ould overtop the judgment debt. 

5       First, the plaintiffs assert that Far East Packaging had dishonestly assisted Mr W u and Mr Lim in the latters’ breaches of their fiduciary duties and/or breaches of trusts. These tw o executives had misrepresented to Quanzhou Hengw ei and the Joint Venture Company that various trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengw ei amounting to the total value RMB5.7 million had not paid those debts, w hen in truth and in fact these debts had been paid to Quanzhou Hengw ei. The plaintiffs further claim that Far East Packaging had know ingly received RMB1,244,108.45 as constructive trustee of the Joint Venture Company and/or Quanzhou Hengw ei. In this connection, the plaintiffs allege that Far East Packaging and Mr CC Thing had through their representatives Mr W u and Mr Lim fraudulently misrepresented to the Joint Venture Company and Quanzhou Hengw ei that Quanzhou Hengw ei w ere liable in the said sum for "handling fees" and/or "general fees" w hen in fact all of them knew that the representations w ere false. They all knew that the said sum should not have been paid. 

6       In amplifying the allegations, it is alleged that Far East Packaging had in connection w ith its management of Quanzhou Hengw ei appointed one Mr Zhu Yi Qing ("Mr Zhu") as a sales manager of the factory. At that time, Mr CC Thing, Mr W u and Mr Lim w ere authorised to run the day to day business of Quanzhou Hengw ei. Accordingly, Mr Zhu ow ed the follow ing fiduciary duties to Quanzhou Hengw ei, namely: (1) to collect debts from the trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengw ei and hand them to the accounts department; (2) to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company; (3) not to place himself in a position in w hich his personal interests did or might conflict w ith the interests of the company; and (4) to hold w hatever monies and property collected from the trade debtors on trust for Quanzhou Hengw ei. In addition, Far East Packaging and Mr CC Thing, according to the plaintiffs also ow ed the last three named fiduciary duties to the Joint Venture Company and Quanzhou Hengw ei. 

7       Mr Zhu had in a statement in Chinese disclosed w hat had transpired. He said that he w as appointed a s manager of the business department of Quanzhou Hengw ei in March 1996. He w as responsible for marketing and for the collection of debts from customers. Mr Lim as representative of Far East Packaging w as appointed executive director and general manager of Quanzhou Hengw ei. Mr W u assisted Mr Lim in the management of Quanzhou Hengw ei. Mr Zhu alleges that in 1998 Mr CC Thing, one Mr Teng Chiang Keow , Mr W u and Mr Lim had conspired w ith him (Mr Zhu) to hatch a plan. Under it, it w as agreed that monies collected from trade debtors w ould be paid into their individual personal accounts and the proceeds w ould be used to incorporate and fund a new company to be set up to compete w ith the business of Q u a n z h o u Hengw ei. Mr CC Thing promised that Mr Zhu and Mr W u w ould be allotted 10% of the shareholdings of the new company. Mr CC Thing promised that he w ould incorporate the company in Singapore w hich w ould be used, in turn, to form a company in Quanzhou, PRC. The company formed in Singapore w as, in the event, Sin Quan Packaging Pte Ltd w hich w as incorporated on 18 May 1998. In fact, 


according to the plaintiffs, at a manager’s meeting at the end of 1999 Mr Zhu admitted in the presence of Mr CC Thing, Mr W u and the representatives of the plaintiffs, one Mr Dai Zhi Xin, a sales representative of Quanzhou Hengw ei and Mr Go Tw an Heng (" Mr Go") that Far East Packaging had instructed him to divert funds from Quanzhou Hengw ei to Far East Packaging. The total amount diverted w as approximately RMB2. million. At that meeting, Mr CC Thing told Mr Go that Mr W u had "taken" RMB2.4 million from the trade debtors and that Far East Packaging w ould repay this sum. According to Mr Go, Mr CC Thing had at the same time promised that he (Mr CC Thing) w ould be personally liable for the RMB2.4 million. 

8       In the statement, Mr Zhu also referred to various payments from his personal account into w hich the funds collected from the trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengw ei had been deposited. He had on Mr W u’s instructions paid RMB20,000 to one Cheng Xiang, the driver of Mr CC Thing. According to Mr Zhu, Mr W u had said that the money w as meant for the girlfriend of Mr CC Thing. On another occasion, Mr Zhu had paid Mr W u RMB20,000 at the latter’s request. 

9       Mr Zhu in the statement further alleged that he had handed over to Mr W u the sum of RMB350, w hich Mr W u had paid over to the Shanghainese girlfriend of Mr Teng. He further alleged that Mr W u had instructed one Mr Li Po and one Mr Lin Lian Fang to collect monies from the trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengw ei and that Mr W u had received about RMB300,000 to RMB400,000 from these collectors. 

10     Mr Go in his affidavit in support of the plaintiffs’ application herein asserts that Mr Zhu and Mr W u had collected from trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengw ei the approximate sum of RMB5.7 million. In several subparagraphs under para 19 of his affidavit Mr Go listed the breakdow n. 

11     Another head of claim is in relation to the sum of RMB1,244,108.45 w hich w ere paid out by Quanzhou Hengw ei for "handling fees" or "general fees" w hich the plaintiffs assert w ere not genuine liabilities at all. They w ere paid out against 9 vouchers issued in 1997. In 1997 the total import of paper to Quanzhou Hengw ei w as 1089.66 metric tons. According to the customs documents the import and export of the paper w as tax exempted. There could not have been such substantial, extraordinary and apparently unexplained liabilities. The plaintiffs assert that Far East Packaging caused these payments to be made by Mr Lim and Mr W u to themselves or to third parties w hen there w as no justification for such payments. 

12     By a letter of 22 June 2001 a director of the Joint Venture Company appointed by the plaintiffs under the Joint Venture Agreement called for the convening of the Directors’ Meeting and an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Joint Venture Company to consider the commencement of legal proceedings to claim against Far East Packaging and Mr CC Thing for the recovery of monies of Quanzhou Hengw ei w hich w ere dishonestly retained or diverted by them. In July 2001 the directors of the Joint Venture Company w ho w ere appointed by Far East Packaging replied to the effect that they w ere abstaining to vote. Those directors did not turn up at the scheduled meetings. They also failed to attend the adjourned meetings. As cla u s e 4.5 of the Joint Venture Agreement dated 27 March 1996 stipulated that the quorum for any directors’ meeting shall be at least one director of the Joint Venture Company appointed by the plaintiffs and one director appointed by Far East Packaging, no valid meeting w as convened and there w as no corporate approval to commence the legal proceedings. The plaintiffs contend that Far East Package had unreasonably refused to attend the directors’ meeting and authorised the commencement of the legal proceedings. 

13     In response to the contention of the first three defendants that Quanzhou Hengw ei, and not its parent (the Joint Venture Company), has the locus standi to commence legal proceedings against Far East Packaging, Mr CC Thing and others, the plaintiffs through their solicitors sought the opinion on Chinese law in relation to three questions. The first question is w hether there is any equivalent of s 216A of the Act in Chinese Company law that gives a shareholder of a company the right to sue in the name of the company. The second question is w hether, under the law of China concerning enterprises w ith Sole Foreign 


Investment and Detailed Rules for the implementation of the Law of China on Sole Foreign Investment Enterprises, there are equivalent provisions similar to s 216A of the Act. The third question is this: if there is a deadlock betw een the shareholders of a company in not being able to procure or cause the company to sue the debtors, how w ould the Courts in China deal w ith the situation. In December 2001 Mr W an Hailong, a licensed practising law yer in the PRC, of 9 years’ standing gave his opinion on the 3 legal questions. He opined that under the Companies Act and the Foreign Capital Enterprises Act and their relevant rules and regulations, there is nothing that is similar to those of section 216A of the Act. He further stated in his opinion that if there are tw o camps of shareholders w ith conflicting view s resulting in a situation w here the company cannot pass a resolution to sue in the name of the company, then the Court w ill not deal w ith the compa ny’s claims against its debtors. These view s w ere not challenged by the first three defendants and no contrary opinions on the relevant Chinese law s w ere proffered. Accordingly, the conclusion is that in a stalemate, such as the one in this instant case, Quanzhou Hengw ei w ill have no recourse and w ill be unable to enforce its rights against Far East Packaging and its appointed directors in the Joint Venture Company and Quanzhou Hengw ei w ould not approve of any such legal action. In those circumstances, it seems to me that there must be very compelling reasons w hy the Joint Venture Company should be refused any leave to commence legal proceedings against the w rongdoers and allegedly bad fiduciaries. 

**Section 216A of the Act** 

14     Ordinarily, a company by its majority members or its Board should decide w hether to prosecute or defend a claim. Occasionally, it is not possible to obtain Board’s approval because the potential defendant’s approval is required and it is w ithheld. That is to be expected because a person w ould not ordinarily authorise its company to sue him. A member of the company, if he has a legitimate claim, may apply for leave to bring an action in the name and on behalf of the company. Under subsection 216A(3) of the Act, how ever, it must be show n that the complainant is acting in good faith and that it appears to be prima facie in the interest of the company that the action be brought. 

15     In this case, the first three defendants contend that the ability of the Joint Venture Company to bring action to recover reflective losses had been authoritatively restated by the House of Lords in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm)_ [2001] 2 W LR 72. Counsel for the first three defendants points out that the alleged losses and damages suffered by the Joint Venture Company w ere essentially (if proven) a reduction in the value of its shareholdings in Quanzhou Hengw ei. Such reduction in the value of the shares is a reflection of the loss suffered by Quanzhou Hengw ei. If Quanzhou Hengw ei sues and successfully recovers the losses and damages, then the Joint Venture Company w ill be fully compensated and the value of its shares w ill remain intact. The House of Lords decided that as a matter of policy a shareholder should be precluded from recovering a reflective loss. As Lord Millet explained, disallow ing a corporate claim w ould prejudice the company’s creditors if the company becomes insolvent as a result of the w rongdoing. The interests of other shareholders w ould also be adversely affected. In addition, the House of Lords disapproved of Johnson challenging ‘in one capacity the adequacy of the terms he had agreed in the other’. 

16     The facts in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co_ may be stated briefly. Gore W ood, a firm of solicitors, had acted for Johnson’s company, in w hich he held all but tw o shares. It w as alleged that the solicitors had acted negligently and had failed to exercise an option to purchase the land for Johnson’s company. The company sued the solicitors and it w as settled by the payment of a large sum to that company. After the payment, Johnson also claimed damages for negligence on the ground that the solicitors had also assumed certain duties tow ards him as the substantial shareholder. As some of the losses claimed by Johnson w ere also losses w hich his company had suffered and w hich had been settled, the solicitors applied to strike out those claims on the ground that they w ere reflective losses and Johnson w as not entitled personally to recover them. The House of Lords struck out those claims w hich w ere reflective losses but allow ed the others to go to trial. 


17     The issue raised in this case has implications both in principle and in terms of policy. The principles of corporate identity and autonomy are established in _Salomon v Salomon_ [1896] AC 22 and _Foss v Harbottle_ (1843) 2 Hare 461 w hich decided respectively the cardinal principles that a duly incorporated company is separate in law from its members and that the majority of members is entitled to exercise its pow ers and control its operations generally. The notable exception to the last named principle is that the majority cannot by those pow ers and control commit a fraud on the minority nor oppress it by the exercise of those pow ers and control. The question is under w hat circumstances it is right to make an exception and effectively lift the corporate veil w ith the effect that interests of shareholders are identified w ith those of the company. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in _Christensen v Scott_ [1996] 1 NZLR 273 and the English Court of Appeal i n _Barings plc v Coopers & Lybrand_ [1997] 1 BCLC 427 had made exceptions to those principles of keeping separate a company from its shareholders. In those cases, it w as respectively decided, inter alia, that a loss suffered by a company could also be suffered by an individual shareholder and that a reflective loss may be recoverable by a shareholder. But the House of Lords in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co_ has decided only a company can maintain an action to recover reflective losses and that a shareholder is precluded from doing so. 

18     Lord Bingham in his leading Speech considered _Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd_ [1982] 1 All ER 354 **,** _Barings plc v Coopers & Lybrand and Christensen v Scott_ and stated at pp 94E-95B: 

"These authorities support the follow ing propositions. (1) W here a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty ow ed to it, only the company may sue in respect of that loss. No action lies at the suit of a shareholder suing in that capacity and no other to make good a diminution in the value of the shareholder’s shareholding w here that merely reflects the loss suffered by the company. A claim w ill not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss w hich w ould be made good if the company’s assets w ere replenished through action against the party responsible for the loss, even if the company, acting through its constitutions organs, has declined or failed to make good that loss. So much is clear from _Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v. Newman Industries Ltd (No. 2)_ [1982] Ch 204, particularly at pp 2 2 2 – 2 2 3 , _Heron International_ , particularly at pp 261-262, _George Fischer, particularly at pp 266 and 270-271, Gerber and Stein v Blake_ , particularly at pp 726-729. (2) W here a company suffers loss but has no cause of action to sue to recover that loss, the shareholder in the company may sue in respect of it (if the shareholder has a cause of action to do so), even though the loss is a diminution in the value of the shareholding. This is supported b y _Lee v Sheard_ [1956] 1 QB 192, 195-196, _George Fischer and Gerber._ (3) W here a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty to it, and a shareholder suffers a loss separate and distinct from that suffered by the company caused by breach of a duty independently ow ed to the shareholder, each may sue to re cove r the loss caused to it by breach of the duty ow ed to it but neither may recover loss caused to the other by breach of the duty ow ed to that other. I take this to be the effect of _Lee v Sheard,_ at pp 195-196, _Heron International,_ particularly at p 262, _R P Howard,_ particularly at p 123, _Gerber and Stein v Blake,_ particularly at p 726. I do not think the observations of Leggatt L J in _Barings_ at p 435 and of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in _Christensen v Scott_ at p 280, lines 25-35, can be reconciled w ith this statement of principle." 

19     Lord Bingham summarised the reasoning at p 95C as follow s: 

"On the one hand the court must respect the principle of company automony, ensure that the company’s creditors are not prejudiced by the action of individual shareholders and ensure that a party does not recover compensation for a loss w hich another party has suffered. On the other, the court must be astute to ensure that the party w ho has in fact suffered loss is not arbitrarily denied fair compensation. The problem can be resolved only by close scrutiny of the pleadings at the strike-out stage and all the proven facts at the trial stage: the object is to ascertain w hether the loss claimed appears to be or is one w hich w ould be made good if the company had enforced its full rights against the party responsible, and w hether (to use the language of _Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No 2)_ [1982] Ch 204, 223) the 


loss claimed is " _merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company"._ In some cases the answ er w ill be clear, as w here the shareholder claims the loss of dividend or a diminution in the value of a shareholding attributable solely to depletion of the company’s assets, or a loss unrelated to the business of the company. In other cases, inevitably, a finer judgment w ill be called for. At the strike-out stage any reasonable doubt must be resolved in favour of the claimant." 

20     The principle in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co_ w as applied recently in _Shaker v Mohammed Al-Bedrawi_ [2001] EW HC Ch 159. Mr Justice Law rence Collins said at paras 28 and 29: 

 " In Johnson v Gore Wood the House of Lords disapproved the approach of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Christensen v Scott [1996] 1 NZLR 273 (applied by the Court of Appeal in Barings plc v Coopers & Lybrand [1997] 1 BCLC 427) in allow ing a personal claim for diminution in the value of shares allegedly caused by the negligence of accountants and solicitors in advising on the company taking a lease of farm land ... These decisions are disapproved in Johnson v Gore Wood by all the members of the House (except Lord Cooke of Thorndon), although it is apparent that Lord Hutton did so w ith some reluctance." 

21     The same issue arose for consideration in _Eric Terence Day v James Thomas Gregory Cook_ [2001] EW CA Viv 592. The question in that case w as w hether Day could recover damages against his solicitor, Cook, for the loss in value of his shareholding in his principal trading company caused by his solicitor’s breach of duty. Lady Justice Arden referred to Lord Bingham’s speech in _Johnson_ and said at para 36: 

 "Lord Goff gave a concurring speech, and agreed w ith Lord Millett’s analysis (below ) of the earlier case law. Lord Cooke of Thornden concurred in the result, but considered in some cases it w as possible that the shareholder w ould suffer additional loss. He cited the case of Christensen v Scott [1 9 9 6 ] 1 NZLR 273, w here a shareholder w as permitted to pursue a claim for reflective loss after the company’s claim had been settled. Lord Hutton agreed w ith the result, holding that the approach in Prudential Assurance v Newman should be preferred to that in Christensen v Scott as it had stood for almost 20 years." 

Lady Justice Arden continued at paras 38 to 40 as follow s: 

 "It w ill thus be seen from the speeches in Johnson v Gore Wood that w here there is a breach of duty to both the shareholder and the company and the loss w hich the shareholder suffers is merely a reflection of the company’s loss there is now a clear rule that the shareholder cannot recover. That follow s from the graphic example of the shareholder w ho is led to part w ith the key to the company’s money box and the theft of the company’s money from that box. It is not simply the case that double recovery w ill not be allow ed, so that, for instance if the company’s claim is not pursued or there is some defence to the company’s claim, the shareholder can pursue his claim. The company’s claim, if it exists, w ill alw ays trump that of the 


 shareholder. Accordingly the court has no discretion. The claim ca nno t be entertained. The English rule is therefore different from the position in New Zealand: see Christiansen (sic) v Scott, above. Even in the case of ow ner-managed companies, there is no discretion." 

22     Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted, in rebuttal, that the facts of the instant case fall w ithin propositions (2) and (3) of Lord Bingham’s summary in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co_. He relies on the fact that Quanzhou Hengw ei has no cause of action or is unable to enforce its full rights, for w hich he relies on the evidence of the expert on Chinese law. I find considerable force behind these submissions, w hich I accept. The facts in the instant case falls w ithin propositions (2) and (3) of Lord Bingham. A litigant is not to be lightly turned aw ay from bringing a genuine cause before our Courts. A fortiori, if there is no risk of double recovery and there is no prejudice to the creditors or shareholders of the company, w hich has no remedy in any event under Chinese law , the policy reasons behind the decision in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co_ do not apply. Accordingly, the Joint Venture Company as the sole shareholder of Quanzhou Hengw ei has the right and title to bring the action to recover the claims. W hether it succeeds or not depends on the evidence it can gather and present to Court. There is a prima facie case. The application is allow ed. There w ill be an order in terms of prayers 1, 2, 3 and 5 set out in the Originating Summons. Other prayers regarding the future conduct and costs of the proceedings are adjourned for further consideration. Parties are also directed to settle the draft orders of Court for my approval.
