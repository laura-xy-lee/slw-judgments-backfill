Woo Bih Li J: 

**Background** 

1       The defendant Ng Tuc k Chuan, also known as Jason (“Jason”), was a direc tor and the managing direc tor of the plaintiff, a c ompany inc orporated in Singapore known as Helukabel Singapore Pte Ltd (“HS”) from 7 November 2000 to 13 August 2007. HS is a supplier of various types of c ables. It obtains its supply from its parent c ompany in Germany known as Helukabel GmbH (“H GmbH”). 

2       Jason was dismissed by two other direc tors of HS, Bernd J Goetze (“Goetze”) and Helmut Luksc h (“Luksc h”) from all positions in HS on 13 August 2007. 

3       HS relied on a number of breac hes by Jason of his duty of fidelity and fiduc iary duty to justify the dismissal and also c laimed various sums of money from Jason. In turn, Jason c ounterc laimed for his salary for the 13 days of August 2007 and three months’ pay in lieu of a reasonable period of notic e of termination on the basis that he had been wrongfully dismissed. 

4       The witnesses for HS were Luksc h, Teh Choon Hoc k (“Teh”) who joined HS on 1 Oc tober 2007 and bec ame its managing direc tor a few days later and Ng Poh Foong, also known as Cynthia (“Cynthia”), an ac c ounts and administrative exec utive of HS who joined HS on 23 September 2005. Jason was the only witness for himself. Muc h of the evidenc e for HS was based on doc umentary evidenc e with some c oming from Cynthia’s personal knowledge. A former general manager, Julie Lau Meow Hoon (“Julie”) whose evidenc e would have been helpful was not c alled to give evidenc e. Neither did Cynthia’s predec essor, Cec ilia Ng (“Cec ilia”) give evidenc e. Cec ilia is Cynthia’s sister. No reason was given for the omission to c all Julie or Cec ilia. On the other hand, Jason’s evidenc e c onsisted primarily of bare or brief allegations. This was the unsatisfac tory state of evidenc e before me. I will now set out the various allegations against Jason. Referenc es to the agreed bundle will begin with the prefix “AB” and then the page number. 

**A. Involvement with IMI Kabel Pte Ltd (“IMI”)** 

5       IMI was inc orporated in Singapore on 1 November 2006. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of All Grand Enterprises Ltd (“All Grand”), a c ompany inc orporated in the British Virgin Islands. All Grand is in turn 70% owned by Karin Tec hnology BVI Limited whic h is a wholly owned subsidiary of Karin Tec hnology Holdings Limited (“Karin Holdings”), a c ompany apparently inc orporated in Hong Kong and listed on the main board of the Singapore Exc hange (see AB 24). 


6       HS sold c ables to IMI who in turn sold suc h c ables to others. Although Jason referred to IMI as a c ustomer of HS, it was not really disputed that IMI was a c ompetitor of HS as well. 

7       Jason’s involvement with IMI was mentioned in email exc hanges with various persons in the Karin group. For example, one was an email dated 12 July 2007 from a Yap Thian Soon (“Yap”) to Cynthia whic h enc losed a doc ument stating that Jason held a 25% stake in IMI. However, Cynthia was not in a position to verify this information and Yap was not c alled as a witness. 

8       Another example was an email dated 31 July 2007 from one Kim to Yap seeking Jason’s signature to c onfirm an advanc e from Karin Tec hnology BVI Limited to All Grand of HK$2,722,627. 

9       A third email dated 2 August 2007 was from Jason himself to one Stephen Chong of Karin Holdings about a visit to Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Referenc e was made therein to “the lawyer draft” but Jason said he c ould not rec all what that was about. 

10     There was also a payment vouc her dated 28 June 2007 on IMI’s letterhead approved by Jason to authorise payment to HS of $21,840 for a c able c utting and c oiling mac hine. Jason also admitted in his defenc e at [4] that he was a c o-signatory of IMI’s OCBC bank ac c ount No 517XXXXXXXXX but he alleged that his status as a c o-signatory of IMI did not affec t his duties or obligations to HS. 

11     Jason denied owning any shares in IMI or in any of the Karin c ompanies. He also denied being a direc tor. 

12     Jason’s explanation for his involvement with IMI was found in [23] of his affidavit of evidenc ein-c hief (“AEIC”). He said the initial direc tors of IMI were two Chinese nationals and Yap. Yap was new to the c able business and not familiar to representatives of Karin Holdings. Due to Jason’s c lose relationship with direc tors of Karin Holdings, they asked him to help set up IMI’s operations in Singapore inc luding looking for suitable premises for IMI and the opening of a bank ac c ount (with OCBC) for IMI. Eventually, he was removed as a signatory of IMI’s bank ac c ount. 

13     I found Jason’s explanation to be unc onvinc ing. He was obviously more involved than he c ared to admit. While the full details of his involvement were not disc losed and it remained unc lear whether he was a direc tor or shareholder of IMI, or any of the Karin c ompanies, I was satisfied that he was involved in the operations of IMI and was in breac h of his duty of fidelity and fiduc iary duty to HS. This reason alone was suffic ient to justify his dismissal although there was no c laim by HS for damages for these breac hes. 

**B. Transactions not at arm’s length** 

14     There were two sets of transac tions under this heading. 

15     The first set of transac tions involved the sale of c ables to IMI at disc ounted or low pric es whic h allowed IMI to re-sell the same to third parties like EIE Industrial Produc ts Sdn Bhd (“EIE”) and Transtel Engineering Pte Ltd (“Transtel”) at higher pric es. The table of suc h transac tions is as follows: 

 Date Invoice No IMI paid to HS IMI resold to IMI’s resale price 

## 22.03.07 20620 $119,656.40 EIE $125,942. 


 19.04.07 20745 $ 14,600.00 Transtel $ 18,000. 

 28.05.07 20868 $113,382.50 Transtel $163,394. 

 01.06.07 20884 $ 45,922.92 Transtel $ 48,790. 

## $293,561.82 $356,126. 

16     Jasons’s response was that HS did not sell c ables to IMI at disc ounted pric es. He was not personally aware of the HS invoic es involved, _ie_ , Nos 20620, 20745, 20868, 20884 as they were handled by his sales staff. The invoic es were issued to “CASH”. It was Cynthia who later wrote ‘IMI Kabel” thereon in the c ourse of investigations by HS. 

17     It turned out that Jason had himself signed two of HS’s invoic es, _ie_ , Nos 20620 and 20868. His son, Jerome (who was then working in HS) had signed No 20745. Jason did not dispute that he must have been aware of what Jerome had done. There were also c orresponding invoic es from IMI to its c ustomers whic h showed the higher pric es whic h IMI was c harging to its c ustomers. In the c irc umstanc es, I was of the view that Jason should be liable for the differenc e between the IMI invoic es and the first three HS invoic es, _ie_ , Nos 20620, 20743 and 20868 (whic h he or Jerome had signed) amounting to a total differenc e of $59,697.54. 

18     The sec ond set of transac tions c onc erned a sale of c ables whic h was to be sold to Transtel. However, Jason authorised the sale of the c ables to Karin Elec tronic Supplies Co Ltd (“Karin Elec tronic ”) first for 132,123.08 euros as evidenc ed by a tax invoic e no 20108 from HS dated 17 November 2006. He then c aused HS to purc hase the same c ables from Karin Elec tronic for 182,123.08 euros, that is, a mark-up of 50,000 euros as evidenc ed by an invoic e dated 27 November 2006 from Karin Elec tronic. 

19     Jason did not dispute that he was responsible for these transac tions. His explanation was that at the relevant time, _ie_ , between November 2006 to January 2007, HS had a severe c ash-flow problem. He then dec ided to sell the c ables to Karin Elec tronic first with a 5% profit to obtain c ash from Karin Elec tronic to meet payment to staff and suppliers. However, when the bank statements of HS for the relevant months were produc ed, these statements showed that there were c redit balanc es for eac h of the three months averaging between about $181,000 to $354,000. Jason’s response was that suc h balanc es were inadequate bec ause HS’s turnover was $10 million a year. However, his reason for c ausing HS to pay Karin Elec tronic 50,000 euros more to buy bac k the same c ables met with other diffic ulties. 

20     First, there was no evidenc e that HS had rec eived the 132,123.08 euros, or its Singapore dollar equivalent, promptly from Karin Elec tronic in November or Dec ember 2006. 

21     Sec ondly, the invoic e from HS to Karin Elec tronic did not require c ash payment to be made immediately. Instead, the HS invoic e to Karin Elec tronic allowed it to pay within 30 days and likewise, the invoic e from Karin Elec tronic to HS allowed HS to pay within 30 days. 

22     Thirdly, there was no reason for HS to pay suc h an exorbitant differenc e for Karin Elec tronic ’s invoic e whic h had the same c redit terms as HS’s and whic h was only ten days apart. 

23     It is c lear to me that Jason’s explanation was false. Therefore, he should be liable for the differenc e of 50,000 euros whic h was treated as equivalent to $105,000. 


**C. Purchase and payment of stock for IMI** 

24     HS alleged that Jason had ordered c ables whic h were stamped with the words “IMI Kabel” for IMI but he had not ac ted in the best interest of HS when he did so bec ause suc h c ables c ould only be sold to IMI or at a disc ount to others. In any event, as HS withdrew its c laim for damages for the remaining unsold c ables, no damages are payable by Jason under this heading. 

**D. Diversion of business inquiries to a Karin entity or to IMI** 

25     HS c omplained that Jason had rec eived business inquiries from CIMC-Tianda Airport Support Ltd (“CIMC-Tianda”) and various third parties whic h he wrongfully referred to a Karin entity or to IMI. 

26     In his defenc e at [8], Jason said that he was unaware of any business inquiry from CIMCTianda or from other third parties. He also denied improperly direc ting the inquiries to a Karin entity or IMI. 

27     There was an email dated 19 July 2007 evidenc ing the business inquiry from CIMC Tianda and asking for the telephone c ontac t of HS’s agent in China. Jason forwarded this inquiry to Stephen Chong of a c ompany referred to as Karin Tec hnology. His reason for doing so was that HS did not have a branc h offic e in China then and Karin Tec hnology had been appointed HS’s distributor of c ables in China. Yet, there was no doc umentary evidenc e that this Karin Tec hnology had been appointed as an agent for HS in China. Moreover, Jason ac c epted that H GmbH had a branc h offic e in Shenzhen. Furthermore, Jason’s purported ignoranc e of the business inquiry from CIMC-Tianda reflec ted poorly on his c redibility. I was of the view that he was wrongly direc ting a business enquiry to Karin Tec hnology. 

28     As for the business enquiries from other third parties, Jason’s reason was that HS did not supply the items whic h were the subjec t of the inquiries and it was not worth HS’s while to try and sourc e for the items and so he passed on the inquiries to IMI. It is not nec essary for me to make a finding on these other inquiries as HS was not c laiming damages (or sec ret profits) for them but only to establish that there was suffic ient reason to dismiss Jason. For the reasons set out above and other reasons below, I was of the view that there was suffic ient reason to dismiss Jason. 

**E. Monies had and received** 

29     There were several items under this heading. The first was a sum of $15,906.98 whic h was supposed to be a 5% sales rebate to a c ustomer, Elec tplus Industry Sdn Bhd (“Elec tplus”) for surpassing a minimum turnover of $300,000. However, HS’s c heque No 302471 for $15,906.98 was made out in the personal name of an offic er or direc tor of Elec tplus, one Tam Kiew Hua (“Tam”) purportedly at the request of the c ustomer and c redited into Tam’s ac c ount with OCBC on 31 Dec ember 2002. Thereafter, some months later, Tam issued a c heque dated 18 July 2003 for the same sum in favour of Jason under his name Ng Tuc k Chuan. Although there was no direc t evidenc e that this c heque was in fac t c redited into Jason’s ac c ount, I found Jason’s “explanation” telling. He did not ac tually deny rec eiving the c heque or the money as suc h. All he said in his AEIC was that “I honestly do not rec all rec eiving this c heque, nor the reasons for this payment, as it had been more than 5½ to 6 years ago. However, I only wish to point out that this payment was made, if at all, to me some seven months later...”. If Jason had really wanted to c hec k whether he had rec eived the funds, he c ould have asked for the relevant bank statements from his bank. True, HS c ould also have asked for a c opy of his relevant bank statement but that would assume that Jason would disc lose all his bank ac c ounts. 


30     On balanc e, I am satisfied that he had rec eived the funds. He had made a sec ret profit at the expense of HS and has to repay the $15,906.98 to HS. 

31     The next sum under this heading was an amount of $38,190. Ac c ording to Cynthia, she had witnessed Julie handing c ash of $38,190 on or about 7 Marc h 2006 to Jason in Jason’s offic e and telling Jason that suc h c ash belonged to HS. Cynthia said she had written the transac tion on a piec e of paper but that piec e of paper was no longer available. 

32     Jason denied that he had rec eived the c ash. In [38] and [39] of his AEIC, he said that he had dismissed Julie for non-performanc e as a general manager in mid-2007 and he believed she harboured a grudge against him. At trial, he ac c epted that he did not dismiss Julie. She had resigned. He also withdrew his allegation that she harboured a grudge against him. More importantly, Jason’s AEIC had assumed that it was Julie who was going to testify against him on this sum. He had not rec koned that Cynthia was going to be the witness testifying against him. He had no explanation why Cynthia would make a false ac c usation of suc h a nature against him. 

33     It seemed to me that Cynthia was more c andid than Jason. I ac c ept her testimony on this item. Jason has to pay HS $38,190 whic h he had rec eived. 

34     The third sum under this heading was $4,047.15 c omprising two sums of $2,047.15 and $2,000. 

35     Cynthia relied on a statement (dated 19 September 2005) prepared by Cec ilia (“AB 122”) whic h showed that Jason and others were holding money belonging to HS. In that statement, Jason was supposed to be holding $2,047.15 rec eived from a c ustomer Union Steel Pte Ltd (“Union Steel”). This was “supported” by an HS invoic e No 2002/11/01 dated 5 November 2002 (AB 123) whic h was supposed to be for the sale of sc rap c ables to Union Steel at $2,047.15. There was a sentenc e in the invoic e stating that the c heque was to be made payable to “MR NG TUCK CHUAN”. This suggested that Union Steel was to issue payment to Jason for the sc rap c ables. 

36     However, HS’s invoic e was prepared by Cec ilia and signed by Julie, neither of whom gave evidenc e. AB 122 was the statement prepared by Cec ilia and, as mentioned, she did not give evidenc e. There was a payment vouc her whic h appeared to be on Union Steel’s letterhead stating that payment of $2,047.15 was to be made to Mr Ng Tuc k Chuan and handwritten words “Rec ’d 11/11/02” thereon. However, those words were written by Cec ilia, not Jason. 

37     Unlike the c ase for the $15,906.98 where there was at least evidenc e of a c heque issued by Tam in favour of Ng Tuc k Chuan, no suc h evidenc e was available before me for the $2,047.15. Ac c ordingly, it is not safe for me to hold Jason liable for the $2,047.15. 

38     AB 122 also showed that Jason had rec eived c ash of $2,000 from another c ustomer Wee Tiong Wah. At AB 128, there was a statement of ac c ount referring to c ables sc rapped from 22 to 24 September 2003. The c ash rec eived was $8,741.04. After deduc ting $6,741.04 for HS’s invoic e No 14890 dated 24 September 2003, $2,000 c ash was supposed to be handed to Jason. However, as mentioned earlier, Cec ilia did not give evidenc e on AB 122. Also, no one who had personal knowledge of the doc ument at AB 128 gave evidenc e for HS. For example, if the invoic e No 14890 was for $6,741.04 only, why was a larger sum of $8,741.04 being paid? Perhaps that invoic e was deliberately under-dec laring the pric e of the c ables sc rapped but this was spec ulative as no one gave evidenc e for HS on this or on the allegation that Jason had rec eived the $2,000. Cynthia was trying to draw inferenc es from doc uments whic h she had no personal knowledge of and suc h doc uments are not enough to hold Jason liable for the $2,000. 


**F. Unauthorised or fictitious claims** 

39     This heading also c omprised several smaller amounts. The first was for $3,180 whic h was paid as a travelling allowanc e to Jason. The payment vouc her dated 8 Oc tober 2002 was signed by Julie and this sum also appeared in the table at AB 122 as being one of the sums rec eived by Jason. Jason alleged that suc h a payment was for authorised business expenses or legitimate business transac tions. 

40     Ac c ording to Cynthia, HS did not have a polic y of granting travelling allowanc e to its employees but Cynthia only joined HS on 23 September 2005. In the light of this evidenc e and the absenc e of evidenc e from Julie and from Cec ilia (who prepared AB 122), there is insuffic ient evidenc e to hold Jason liable for the $3,180. 

41     The sec ond amount under this heading was $1,500 whic h was reflec ted in AB 122 as c ash rec eived from “Sc rap Fund” to be used to exc hange new notes for Chinese New Year. Jason’s response for this sum was the same as for the $3,180. 

42     Again, as Cynthia was not the one who prepared AB 122, there is insuffic ient evidenc e to hold Jason liable for the $1,500. 

43     The third amount c omprised three sums of $18,000 eac h totalling $54,000. 

44     Ac c ording to AB 122, two payments of $18,000 eac h, allegedly for payment of advertising and promotion expenses inc urred by EIE were rec eived by Jason. In this instanc e, there were also two letters dated 15 August 2003 and 1 June 2004 (AB 130 and 133 respec tively) signed by Jason and addressed to EIE stating that HS would pay EIE $18,000 at the beginning and at the end of 2004 respec tively for advertising and promotional ac tivities for the Helukabel brand in Malaysia. From HS’s bank statements, Cynthia managed to trac e the c heques for payment of eac h of these sums to be c ash c heques of $18,000 eac h. 

45     For the third sum of $18,000, Jason had again signed a letter dated 14 November 2006 to EIE stating that HS would pay $18,000 at the end of 2006 for EIE’s advertising and promotional ac tivities for the Helukabel brand in Malaysia. This letter was c ounter-signed by one C M Lee of EIE and a similar signature (of C M Lee) appeared as the rec ipient of the payment on a payment vouc her PV 4211 (at AB 137). However, the payment was also made by a c ash c heque and on this oc c asion, Cynthia did have some personal knowledge of the transac tion. She said that Jason had instruc ted her to prepare the payment vouc her and issue the c ash c heque for the $18,000, telling her that he (Jason) was maintaining an emergenc y fund in c ase HS had insuffic ient c ash to pay staff salaries. 

46     Cynthia stressed that no invoic e was rec eived from EIE for this payment of $18,000 or the earlier two payments of $18,000 eac h. She also stressed that she did not see any evidenc e of any advertising or promotional material from EIE at all. 

47     On the other hand, Jason insisted that all three sums were legitimate expenses for advertising and promotion in Malaysia even though he did not produc e any suc h material. 

48     In suc h c irc umstanc es, I am persuaded on a balanc e of probabilities that Jason had taken eac h of the three sums of $18,000 and they were not paid to EIE. He is to pay the total of $54,000 bac k to HS. 

**G. Unauthorised salary increase ($14,456) and advance ($18,000)** 


49     Jason’s salary was $8,386 per month. He alleged that he had met Luksc h on or about 17 April 2007 at a trade fair in Hanover, Germany and Luksc h had agreed to inc rease his salary to $12,000 a month from April 2007. The differenc e was $3,614 a month and Jason had rec eived the new salary for four months between April to July 2007, both months inc lusive, making a total differenc e of $14,456. 

50     Luksc h denied he had agreed to any inc rease. In the pleadings, he said that any suc h inc rease had to be approved by the direc tors (presumably of HS) but in c ross-examination, he said he meant it had to be approved by c ertain personnel in H GmbH whic h was not done. 

51     Luksc h said that he was surprised and annoyed to see Jason at the trade fair as he was unaware that Jason would be taking time to attend the fair. Luksc h was busy with c lients then. He rec alled Jason mentioning that he wanted an inc rease in salary but Luksc h said he did not agree. Neither did he agree to Jason taking an advanc e of $18,000 on his salary. 

52     Jason’s other point was that Luksc h had told him that sinc e he (Jason) was the managing direc tor, he c ould dec ide on his own salary inc rease and advanc e. 

53     There was no other evidenc e whether by letter, fax or email about the salary inc rease or advanc e although the advanc e was mentioned in a balanc e sheet item (AB 300) but Luksc h was not c ross-examined on this item. In any event, Jason ac c epted that he had to repay the $18, advanc e whether the advanc e had been earlier authorised by Luksc h or not. 

54     As for the inc rease in salary, notwithstanding some minor disc repanc y in Luksc h’s evidenc e, as mentioned above at [50], I found him to be more c redible than Jason. He was visibly annoyed when he desc ribed Jason’s surprise presenc e at the trade fair and the fac t that Jason had mentioned about a salary inc rease then. 

55     I find that Luksc h did not agree to any salary inc rease. Neither was Jason authorised to inc rease his own salary. So, Jason has to return $14,456 (in addition to the $18,000 advanc e). I digress to mention that at AB 142, there is a table of Jason’s salary and bonus from April 2002 to July 

2007\. This table inc luded a mid-year bonus in 2007 and employer’s CPF c ontribution whic h would have inc reased the c laim against Jason from $14,456 to $18,287. However, as the bonus and employer’s CPF c ontributions for the relevant months were not pleaded or raised with Jason, HS’s c ounsel did not pursue the differenc e and was c ontent to rec over $14,456 (and the $18,000 advanc e) under this heading. 

**H. Unauthorised payments to Jerome Ng** 

56     Jerome is Jason’s son. There are two items c laimed by HS under this heading. 

57     The first item is an inc rease of Jerome’s salary from $2,415 to $4,000 per month from 1 July 2006 to 31 July 2007. The inc rease is $1,585 x 13 months = $20,605. Inc luding the employer’s CPF c ontribution on the inc rease, the figure would be $22,796. The sec ond item is a $5,000 bonus or c ommission paid to Jerome on or about 24 July 2007 whic h HS said Jerome was not entitled to. 

58     Jason explained that the previous general manager Julie had left in mid 2006 (although [39] of Jason’s AEIC appeared to have referred to the wrong date of mid-2007 as Julie’s departure date). Julie’s salary was $5,500 per month. However, instead of employing a replac ement, Jason promoted Jerome (who had joined HS on 1 November 2004) to the post of assistant general manager at a monthly salary of $4,000 per month and monthly transport allowanc e of $800. Jerome’s responsibility 


as assistant general manager was sales and administration, management and operation. Ac c ording to Jason, Jerome had taken on additional duties and responsibilities and he had saved HS money instead of employing a replac ement for Julie. Jason had dec ided to assign Jerome additional responsibilities in view of his educ ational (degree) qualific ations and his prior sales whic h was in exc ess of $3 million. 

59     Luksc h appeared unaware that Jerome had joined HS on 1 November 2004. Some time ago, he had asked Jason whether his son would be interested in working for HS and he was then told that Jerome was studying and was not interested in joining HS. Neither was Luksc h aware of Jerome’s promotion. He doubted that Jerome had taken over Julie’s financ ial role as Jerome was lac king in suc h experienc e. 

60     More signific antly, Jason was vague as to what exac tly Jerome did in addition to his duties before his promotion. Jerome himself did not give evidenc e and no one else gave evidenc e on Jerome’s inc reased responsibilities. 

61     In the c irc umstanc es, I am of the view that the inc rease in Jerome’s salary (and CPF) is not justifiable. Jason had taken advantage of the situation to benefit his son at the expense of HS and Jason is to pay $22,796 to HS for this item. 

62     As for the $5,000 bonus to Jerome, HS’s main c omplaint was that Jerome was being paid a bonus when he was leaving to join IMI. On the other hand, Jason said that the bonus was bec ause Jerome had met his sales target of over $1 million in 2007. Based on a c ommission of 1%, Jerome should have rec eived $10,000 but as he left in July 2007, he was given a pro-rated bonus of $5,000. 

63     There was nothing in Jerome’s original letter of appointment dated 1 November 2004 whic h referred explic itly to details of c ommission or bonus although there was a general referenc e to sales turnover target and inc entive. However, there were payment vouc hers showing that Jerome had rec eived bonuses of various amounts like $4,000 and $6,000 for 2006. A payment vouc her dated 15 June 2007 showed that he had rec eived a bonus of $4,000 for 2007. This was in addition to the $5,000 bonus that he rec eived the next month in July 2007 when he was leaving HS. 

64     Jason was not c ross-examined as to how Jerome’s sales and bonus were c alc ulated. As I mentioned, HS’s foc us was on Jerome’s departure for IMI but that was irrelevant. Either Jerome had earned the bonus or he had not. While Jason was not c redible on many aspec ts, I am not able to c onc lude that the bonus of $5,000 to Jerome is a wrongful payment. Therefore, Jason is not liable to HS for this sum. 

**I. Employment of Mohamad Nasrulhaq Bin Mustafa (“Mohamad”)** 

65     Jason had employed Mohamad for HS as an information tec hnology c o-ordinator from 20 November 2006 until Mohamad’s last day with HS on 31 May 2007. Mohamad’s pay during this period, inc luding CPF and Skills Development Levy, was $10,096.26. 

66     HS c laimed Mohamad was in fac t doing work for IMI and not HS whic h had sub-c ontrac ted and outsourc ed its need for information tec hnology to a third party. 

67     It was not disputed that HS had outsourc ed its need for suc h tec hnology to a third party but Jason maintained that Mohamad was employed to support HS not IMI. 

68     On the other hand, Cynthia said that as an ac c ounts and administrative exec utive, she was aware of Mohamad’s sc ope of work in HS. She maintained that he did not do any work for HS. 


Instead, he was c ollating a produc t c atalogue for IMI. This was obvious from the material on his desk and the use of a high resolution sc anner and printer whic h HS had no need for. The produc t c atalogue for IMI was not exhibited with Cynthia’s AEIC but neither was she c hallenged to produc e it. I find Cynthia to be a reliable witness and I ac c ept her evidenc e. In the c irc umstanc es, Jason is liable to HS for $10,096.26 for deliberately putting Mohamad on HS’s payroll when he was not doing work for HS. 

**J. Unauthorised travel expenses** 

69     HS was c laiming from Jason $862 being the c ost of a return airtic ket from Singapore to Wuhan for one Ms Tu Qing (“Tu Qing”) between 14 June 2007 to 24 June 2007 and 4,500.90 Renminbi (“RMB”) being expenses inc urred by Jason and Tu Qing at Ramada Plaza Tian Lu Hotel at Wuhan between 21 and 24 June 2007 on the basis that Tu Qing was not an employee or business assoc iate of HS and the hotel expenses were unc onnec ted with the business of HS. 

70     If indeed the hotel expenses were entirely unc onnec ted with the business of HS, one wonders why HS was not also c laiming for the c ost of Jason’s return air tic ket from Singapore to Wuhan but that is another matter. 

71     The main foc us of this c laim was on Tu Qing. 

72     In [14] of his defenc e and [60] of his AEIC, Jason said that Tu Qing was a c ustomer and/or business assoc iate of HS without identifying whic h c ompany or organisation she was working for or the position she held. Furthermore, Jason’s c ounsel c ould only ask during c ross-examination of Teh if it was possible that Tu Qing was an employee of one of the c ustomers in HS’s c ustomer summary list from AB 175 to 182. I found suc h a question telling as surely Jason would have known whether Tu Qing was an employee of any of the c ustomers in that list and if so, his c ounsel would have immediately pointed out the name of the relevant c ustomer and identified Tu Qing’s designation. It was only after I stressed that parties should not be playing games that Jason’s c ounsel then suggested the next day that Tu Qing was a business assoc iate of HS bec ause she was working for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (“WISCO”) and WISCO was a c ustomer of one of the Karin c ompanies. HS had sold c ables to a Karin c ompany and Karin in turn sold c ables to WISCO. HS had to provide tec hnic al assistanc e to WISCO as the end-user. This “revelation” was quite surprising as the impression that Jason had been giving before was that Tu Qing was an employee of a direc t c ustomer or business assoc iate of HS. That was reinforc ed by the question whic h his c ounsel asked of Teh the day before. 

73     It was also submitted that HS had not paid for the airfare and hotel expenses c laimed as there was no evidenc e of payment by HS but that was not the c rux of Jason’s defenc e. His defenc e suggested that he had ac c epted that HS had paid for the same but that the expenses were legitimate. 

74     It is c lear to me that Tu Qing was not a c ustomer or business assoc iate of HS. She was a female c ompanion of Jason and he had no business c harging her airfare to HS. As for the hotel expenses, HS did not bother to obtain an English translation thereof. The bill showed one item spec ific ally against Tu Qing’s name for 1,940.90 RMB. 

75     In the c irc umstanc es, Jason is liable to pay HS $862 and 1,940.90 RMB. Using an exc hange rate of, say, 100 RMB = $22, 1,940.90 RMB is about $427. 

**K Traffic fine paid by HS** 


76     This is no longer in issue as Jason has reimbursed HS for payment of a traffic fine. 

**L Failure by Jason to devote time to work of HS** 

77     This was a general allegation based on the earlier allegations against Jason. The general allegation was made to support the right to dismiss Jason. No c laim for damages was made against Jason under this heading. 

**Counterclaim by Jason** 

78     Jason is entitled to be paid $5,032.26 being pro-rata payment for his 13 days of servic e in August 2007 until he was dismissed on that day. 

79     I dismiss his c ounterc laim for three months’ pay in lieu of notic e as I found that HS was justified in dismissing him.
