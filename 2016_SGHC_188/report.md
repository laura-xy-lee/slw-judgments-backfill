**Introduction** 

1       Suit No 964 of 2009 (“Suit 964”) was an ac tion by Columbia Asia Healthc are Sdn Bhd (“Columbia”) and PT Nusautama Medic alindo (“PTNM”) against Edward Hong Hin Kit and Albert Hong Hing Kay (c ollec tively “the Hongs”). There were also two other related suits, _viz_ , Suit Nos 861 and 862 of 2008. All three sets of proc eedings were c onsolidated and heard together. The proc eedings arose out of an agreement by Columbia to buy shares in a Singapore c ompany, Universal Medic are Pte Ltd (“UMPL”) whic h in turn owned shares in an Indonesian c ompany, _ie_ , PTNM, whic h owned a hospital erec ted on land in Medan, Indonesia. On 10 April 2014, I issued my judgment (“the Judgment”) in respec t of the three proc eedings. For Suit 964, I granted various reliefs to Columbia against the Hongs. The one that is relevant for present purposes was an order I made granting Columbia judgment against the Hongs for damages to be assessed for the reasonable c osts of taking the nec essary measures to remove a c harge from the land title c ertific ate. This c harge was referred to as “the MEC c harge”. MEC was the ac ronym for a Singapore c ompany Medic al Equipment Credit Pte Ltd whic h had lent money to UMPL and its loan was sec ured by the MEC c harge. 

2       The Hongs appealed to the Court of Appeal against various dec isions of mine in the proc eedings inc luding the above partic ular order for an assessment of damages to be paid by them for the reasonable c osts of removing the MEC c harge. They failed in their appeal against this partic ular order. 

3       The present hearing is for the assessment of damages whic h I had ordered. In the assessment, Columbia was c laiming to rec over legal c osts inc urred and paid to four law firms: 


 3 Rajah & Tann (“R&T”) S$18,097.30 13,183. 

 4 Alan Lim & Salawati (later known as Tengku Mohamed & Alan Lim) (“TMAL”) 

## MYR44,104 14,466. 

 Total: 418,595. 

4       The invoic es from three of the law firms were addressed to and paid by PTNM. The invoic es 

from TMAL were addressed to Columbia but apparently paid by PTNM. [note: 1] 

**Issues** 

5       The Hongs raised many issues in the assessment. I set out the main issues below. 

6       First, they submitted that the order allowed Columbia to rec over the reasonable c osts inc urred by Columbia itself to remove the MEC c harge. In other words, it did not allow Columbia to rec over c osts inc urred by PTNM to remove the MEC c harge. As some of the removal c osts c laimed in the assessment were inc urred by PTNM, Columbia was not entitled to rec over suc h c osts, even if reasonably inc urred, from the Hongs. 

7       Sec ond, the Hongs submitted that insofar as six invoic es (out of 16) from Kusnandar, an Indonesian law firm, were not originals but c opies, they should not be admissible in evidenc e and that the c laim based on these six invoic es must be rejec ted outright. 

8       Third, the Hongs submitted that even if all the invoic es (inc luding the six invoic es) and various Statements of Hours were admissible in evidenc e, the c ontents thereof are hearsay evidenc e and ought to be rejec ted as the maker of the doc uments were not c alled to give evidenc e. 

9       Fourth, the Hongs c ontended that the total amount c laimed by Columbia was manifestly exc essive and unreasonable. This point c overs both the steps taken by various lawyers and the amount c harged by them. 

**The scope of the order on assessment of damages** 

10     I will first address the sc ope of my order. The order did not spec ific ally state that Columbia c ould c laim the removal c osts only if Columbia had inc urred the c osts. The Hongs were interpreting the order to have that c onstraint. On the other hand, it is also true that the order did not spec ific ally state that Columbia c ould c laim the removal c osts even where suc h c osts were inc urred by PTNM. 

11     The answer to this issue lies in the bac kground leading to the making of the order. As Columbia submitted at the assessment hearing, the trial judge was aware that the c osts that Columbia was c laiming had been inc urred by PTNM. The Judgment states at [120] that “Columbia alleged that PTNM inc urred c osts, inc luding legal c osts, to remove the MEC Charge ...”. The Hongs were also aware that c osts had been inc urred by PTNM. 

12     Sinc e the trial judge was prepared to grant Columbia judgment for the reasonable c osts of removing the MEC c harge, it would follow that the trial judge intended to allow Columbia to c laim suc h c osts even where suc h c osts were not inc urred by Columbia itself but by PTNM. Otherwise, the order would have been meaningless right from the time it was made. As the trial judge, I c an c onfirm that 


that was my intention. 

13     In the Hongs’ reply submission for the assessment hearing, the Hongs submitted at para 68 that: 

 The short point is that the liability for the c osts was inc urred by PTNM and not Columbia. This was always obvious and if it was the intention to c laim for PTNM’s loss, an appeal c ould have been filed on this issue or c larific ation sought. Columbia must live with the c onsequenc es. 

14     I am of the view that the above submission applies equally to the Hongs. First, as already mentioned, the parties knew that the c osts of removing the MEC c harge were inc urred by PTNM, not Columbia. Sec ondly, the Hongs c ould have sought c larific ation of my order or filed an appeal. Not having done so, the Hongs must live with the c onsequenc es. 

15     There is one other point on this issue. Columbia had relied on s 8.4.2 of the share sale agreement (“SSA”) to c laim the reasonable c osts of removing the MEC c harge for the assessment hearing. I have set out the terms of s 8.4.2 at [122] of the Judgment. The Hongs submitted at the assessment hearing that at [130] of the Judgment, the trial judge had said that he did not ac c ept that s 8.4.2 was applic able. I would say that the Hongs had taken that ruling out of c ontext. The argument then was whether Columbia was entitled to c laim for diminution in the value of the shares it had ac quired by reason of the existenc e of the MEC c harge or whether it was entitled to c laim only the reasonable c osts of removing the MEC c harge. The trial judge had c onc luded that s 8.4.2 did not allow Columbia to c laim the diminution in the value of the shares sinc e the diminution was not permanent, as the MEC c harge was eventually removed. 

16     I was and am of the view that s 8.4.2, and in partic ular, s 8.4.2.2 of the SSA allows Columbia to c laim from the Hongs the reasonable c osts inc urred to remove the MEC c harge even where the c osts were inc urred by PTNM. In any event, that was and is the sc ope of my order. 

**Whether originals of invoices must be produced and whether hearsay evidence is admissible** 

17     The sec ond and third issues relate to the legal c osts paid by PTNM to Kusnandar and may be dealt with together. 

18     As already mentioned, the Hongs submitted that the c ourt should rejec t six out of the 16 invoic es from Kusnandar as the originals were not produc ed. Furthermore, it was argued that the invoic es and various Statements of Hours should not be admitted in evidenc e as the maker of the doc uments was not c alled to give evidenc e. 

19     Columbia relied on s 32(1)( _b_ )(iv) of the Evidenc e Ac t (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”). This provision states as follows: 

 Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant 

 32.—(1) Subjec t to subsec tions (2) and (3), statements of relevant fac ts made by a person (whether orally, in a doc ument or otherwise), are themselves relevant fac ts in the following c ases: 

 ... 


 or is made in course of trade, business, profession or other occupation; 

 ( b ) when the statement was made by a person in the ordinary c ourse of a trade, business, profession or other oc c upation and in partic ular when it c onsists of — 

 (i) ... 

 (ii) ... 

 (iii) ... 

 (iv) a doc ument c onstituting, or forming part of, the rec ords (whether past or present) of a trade, business, profession or other oc c upation that are rec orded, owned or kept by any person, body or organisation c arrying out the trade, business, profession or other oc c upation, 

 and inc ludes a statement made in a doc ument that is, or forms part of, a rec ord c ompiled by a person ac ting in the ordinary c ourse of a trade, business, profession or other oc c upation based on information supplied by other persons; 

 ... 

20     It is not in dispute that this provision was an amendment to the EA to introduc e a more flexible exc eption to the rule against hearsay evidenc e. In other words, the business rec ords exc eption allows business rec ords to be admissible in evidenc e even though the maker of the doc ument does not give evidenc e. 

21     The Hongs however submitted that Columbia must first satisfy that the invoic es are admissible under s 66 of the EA before Columbia c an rely on s 32(1)( _b_ )(iv). This is bec ause s 66 of the EA requires primary evidenc e of doc uments. Sec ondly, under s 32(3) of the EA, the c ourt may still c onc lude that evidenc e whic h is relevant (or admissible) under s 32(1)( _b_ ) shall not be relevant if it would not be in the interests of justic e to treat it as relevant. 

22     I am of the view that the Hongs’ relianc e on s 66 is misplac ed. It is true that s 66 states that doc uments must be proved by primary evidenc e exc ept in the c ases mentioned in s 67. Under s 64 of the EA, primary evidenc e means that the doc ument itself must be produc ed for the inspec tion of the c ourt. It c an be seen that s 66 read with s 64 means that the original must be produc ed. That is a different question from whether hearsay evidenc e may be admitted. The Hongs had c onflated the two arguments. An original doc ument may be produc ed but the maker of the doc ument may not have given evidenc e on the making of the doc ument. Sec tion 66 deals with the former point and not the latter point. 

23     Sec tion 32(1)( _b_ ) deals with the exc eptions to the hearsay rule. Moreover, s 66 must be read subjec t to s 67A of the EA whic h states that where a statement in a doc ument is admissible in evidenc e by virtue of s 32(1) it may be proved by the produc tion of that doc ument ( _ie_ , the original) or a c opy. 

24     In summary, insofar as the Hongs submitted that the maker of the doc ument must be c alled to give evidenc e, s 32(1)( _b_ )(iv) states that this is not nec essary under c ertain c irc umstanc es. 

25     Insofar as the Hongs submitted that the original must be produc ed, s 66 must be read subjec t 


to s 67A whic h provides that where s 32(1) applies, a c opy may be produc ed. 

26     As Columbia submitted, the Hongs did not dispute that the invoic es of Kusnandar are doc uments whic h form part of the rec ords of Kusnandar whic h is a profession of lawyers. They do c ome within s 32(1)( _b_ )(iv) of the EA. 

27     The only other point left to the Hongs was that the c ourt should nevertheless refuse to allow the c opies of six invoic es to be admitted bec ause it would not be in the interest of justic e to do so. In fac t, this argument c ould also apply to the other ten invoic es bec ause although the originals of these ten invoic es were produc ed, the maker of these invoic es was still not c alled to give evidenc e. 

28     In my view, the c onc erns about admitting doc uments where the maker is not c alled to give evidenc e are the authentic ity and the reliability of the doc uments. Here, as Columbia submitted, the Hongs were not suggesting that any of the invoic es had been fabric ated or were otherwise not genuine invoic es of Kusnandar. Yet the Hongs submitted that they are entitled to objec t to the 

doc uments. [note: 2] The Hongs submitted that the primary c onc ern is the danger of unreliability. [note: 3] The argument was that the invoic es were sent without supporting material to show the 

nature and extent of the work done and the time taken to c arry out the work. 

29     Columbia relied on two sets of Statements of Hours. I will refer to them respec tively as “the 1st Set SH and “the 2nd Set SH”. The 1st Set SH was said to c omprise various Statements of Hours eac h of whic h was enc losed with an invoic e. The 2nd Set SH was supposed to c ontain an elaboration of the hours spent by various lawyers. Furthermore, Columbia submitted that it was not relying solely on the two sets of Statements of Hours as the affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”) of its witness, Aw Tai-Jak (“Aw”), exhibited numerous emails to show the work done. 

30     Leaving aside some alleged minor disc repanc ies in the invoic es, I am of the view that they still provided reliable information as to how muc h Kusnandar had c harged for work done in respec t of the disc harge of the MEC c harge. Whether that information was enough to assist me to determine the reasonableness of the c harges was another matter. 

31     Ac c ordingly, I c onc lude that it is in the interest of justic e to admit the invoic es in evidenc e. Therefore, all the invoic es are admissible and are to be admitted as evidenc e. This applies to originals and c opies. 

**Reasonableness of the steps and quantum claimed** 

32     It seems to me that the real issue is the fourth issue, _ie_ , the reasonableness of the steps and the amount inc urred. 

33     The burden of proof is on Columbia to establish the reasonableness of the steps taken by the various lawyers and the amount of fees inc urred. As the Hongs submitted, even if the fees c harged and paid for were reasonable (from the perspec tive of PTNM or Columbia), this is not proof of the reasonable c ost of c ure to remove the MEC c harge for whic h the Hongs are liable. The invoic es are 

only evidenc e of the c osts inc urred whic h PTNM was prepared to pay. [note: 4] 

**_Kusnandar_** 

34     Columbia c laimed US$183,261.90 as the fees and disbursements of Kusnandar reasonably inc urred to remove the MEC c harge. 


35     Columbia sought to establish the reasonableness of the c harges by relying on the Statement of Hours as well as Aw’s AEIC. Aw was at the material time the legal c ounsel of the Columbia Asia group of c ompanies. Aw’s AEIC sought to elaborate on the work done by Kusnandar and exhibited the 1st Set SH and emails. 

36     Aw said that the 1st Set SH was enc losed with Kusnandar’s invoic es. However, this set of Statements of Hours did not c ontain any detail about the number of hours spent by eac h of Kusnandar’s lawyers, the identity of the lawyers or the rate of c harge of eac h lawyer who did the work. It did c ontain details of the work done by Kusnandar. 

37     As mentioned above, there was the 2nd Set SH. Columbia had disc losed this set whic h c ontained some breakdown of the hours spent by various lawyers and the amounts c harged for eac h lawyer. With suc h information one c ould deduc e the hourly rate of the lawyer c onc erned. 

38     The problem for Columbia was that the 2nd Set SH appeared to have been produc ed for the purpose of litigation. It was not sent in the usual c ourse of Kusnandar’s prac tic e. The sourc e doc uments from whic h the number of hours were attributed to eac h lawyer named were not produc ed. Even though a member of Kusnandar’s prac tic e, Adrio Rivadi Setiawan, gave evidenc e, he was not able to take the matter further as he too did not produc e the sourc e doc uments. Neither did he have personal knowledge of the number of hours spent by eac h and every lawyer who was involved although he did have some general knowledge of the work done. 

39     As for the 1st Set SH, the Hongs raised a question as to whether eac h Statement of Hours was in fac t inc luded with an invoic e as stated in Aw’s AEIC. However, even if eac h Statement of Hours was so inc luded, the fac t remained that they did not c ontain any detail about the number of hours 

spent by eac h of Kusnandar’s lawyers or the identity of the lawyers. Presumably the 2nd set SH was produc ed to address this omission but, as mentioned above, the sourc e doc uments were not produc ed for the 2nd Set SH. Neither was it produc ed for the 1st Set SH. 

40     As already mentioned, Columbia submitted that it was not relying solely on the Statements of Hours. Aw’s AEIC exhibited numerous emails to show the work being done. Unfortunately while those emails did give some information, they still did not give information on the number of hours spent by eac h lawyer who was involved in the matter. 

41     I do not doubt that muc h work was done by Kusnandar to try and get the MEC c harge removed. Although the task of removing the MEC c harge was one whic h appeared c apable of simple resolution, that was not the c ase. If there was no one to sign the disc harge of the MEC c harge bec ause MEC was in liquidation and the liquidators were apparently no longer available, one possibility was to ask the Offic ial Rec eiver in Singapore to sign the disc harge doc ument. If the Offic ial Rec eiver was not prepared to do so, a c ourt order from an Indonesian c ourt to direc t the removal of the MEC c harge should have been a viable alternative sinc e the debt sec ured by the MEC c harge had been paid. Another possible solution was to ask the relevant Indonesian land authority to remove the MEC c harge without more sinc e a view was expressed by one of the land authorities that the MEC c harge itself was illegal for reasons whic h I need not elaborate. However, these options were raised and disc ussed with Kusnandar, but unfortunately they did not make headway. I also note that the Hongs did appoint their own Indonesian lawyer to get the MEC c harge removed and that lawyer too was unsuc c essful. 

42     Therefore it is important to bear in mind that the matter was not as simple as it might appear to be at first blush, and Kusnandar was fac ed with various requirements from authorities whic h c ould not be met. It is not nec essary to restate the requirements here. 


43     However, notwithstanding the fac t that Kusnandar did muc h work, the question was whether their entire legal c osts should be borne by the Hongs. If, for example, two lawyers from Kusnandar were attending the same meeting, should the Hongs pay for both of them? I agree that it may not be right to weigh Columbia’s c laim on nic e sc ales but, on the other hand, it also does appear unjust to land the entire legal c osts at the feet of the Hongs without more. Columbia still has the burden to establish the reasonable amount the Hongs are liable for. 

44     I c ome now to a different point. Colombia/PTNM had enlisted the help of other lawyers to obtain the disc harge of the MEC c harge. Kusnandar had to c ollaborate with eac h of these lawyers. The question arises whether the Hongs should be liable for Kusnandar’s fees (and disbursements) for suc h c ollaboration. 

45     Firstly, Columbia had enlisted the help of Goldman Sac hs (“GS”) to appoint GS’ lawyers in Indonesia, _ie_ , Hiswara Bunjamin & Tandjung (“Hiswara”) to get the MEC c harge removed. Columbia submitted that the Hongs should bear the c ost of Kusnandar’s work with Hiswara. This work inc luded overseeing and c ommenting on the work done by Hiswara. Colombia submitted that the Hongs were already getting the benefit of Hiswara’s servic es free of c harge bec ause Colombia was not c laiming reimbursement of Hiswara’s fees. However, the Hongs c ountered that they should not be responsible for this aspec t of Kusnandar’s work sinc e Kusnandar themselves did not think that Hiswara would ac hieve anything more than Kusnandar. Indeed, there was written evidenc e of emails from Kusnandar c ritic ising the work done by Hiswara. It appeared that the idea to enlist the assistanc e of GS’s Indonesian lawyers did not emanate from Kusnandar who were sc eptic al that suc h lawyers c ould add anything muc h to Kusnanda’s own efforts. It was Columbia itself or its lawyers in another jurisdic tion that c ame up with that idea. 

46     Although there was no suggestion that Kusnandar lac ked the expertise to ac hieve the desired result, it was not able to do so. So I do not fault anyone for trying to get as muc h help as possible from any quarter. However, the point is that Kusnandar itself had not rec ommended the use of GS’s Indonesian lawyers and even appeared to be against that idea. In suc h c irc umstanc es, should the Hongs be responsible for Kusnandar’s work with Hiswara? 

47     I am mindful that Kusnandar also did not support the idea of appointing MC Kaban, another Indonesia law firm, as Kusnandar was not persuaded that MC Kaban c ould add any value to what had already been done. However, the important differenc e is the fac t that MC Kaban did ac hieve the desired result, _ie_ , the removal of the MEC c harge. 

48     Even then the question arises as to whether the Hongs should be liable for Kusnandar’s work in c ollaborating with MC Kaban whic h inc luded overseeing and c ommenting on information rec eived from MC Kaban. For example, after MC Kaban had reported that the MEC c harge was removed, Columbia asked Kusnandar to obtain verific ation of this report. I apprec iate Columbia’s c aution. Columbia had been dealing with Kusnandar over the years with respec t to the ac quisition of the hospital and the land. MC Kaban was a firm that was introduc ed to Columbia rec ently. It made sense for Columbia to seek verific ation. However, the question is whether the Hongs should be liable for Kusnandar’s work in overseeing and c ommenting on MC Kaban’s work _in addition_ to being liable to reimburse Columbia for the c osts of MC Kaban’s work or part thereof. 

49     The third firm of lawyers that Kusnandar had c ollaborated with was R&T. R&T had given advic e as to whether the Offic ial Rec eiver in Singapore will sign a doc ument to disc harge the MEC c harge should the liquidators of MEC be no longer available. 

50     I would think that Kusnandar had also liaised with a fourth firm, _ie_ , TMAL, the Malaysian lawyers 


of Columbia. However sinc e there was no issue about this, I will say no more. 

51     In the c ourse of submissions, it also appeared that Kusnandar’s fees inc luded work to follow up and advise on the efforts of the Hongs to disc harge the MEC c harge. Kusnandar’s fees for this was US$3,150. Although the Hongs did not spec ific ally c hallenge their liability for this fee during the assessment hearing, I am of the view that they are not liable for it for reasons whic h will be stated later. 

52     I note that Hiswara and MC Kaban are Indonesian law prac tic es. Furthermore, as mentioned, Kusnandar did not support the idea of having them involved. Hiswara was not suc c essful but MC Kaban was. I am of the view that it is not reasonable for the Hongs to be liable for Kusnandar’s servic es in c ollaborating with Hiswara. 

53     As for Kusnandar’s servic es in c ollaborating with MC Kaban, the Hongs are already liable in princ iple to pay for MC Kaban’s fees (see [81] below). I am of the view that they should not be liable for Kusnandar’s servic es in c ollaborating with MC Kaban as well. 

54     I used the following analogy to assist me. Columbia, as a c ompany inc orporated in Malaysia, was using a Malaysian law firm, TMAL, to c oordinate the servic es rendered by various law firms in various jurisdic tions inc luding Indonesia and Singapore. In the three sets of proc eedings c ommenc ed in Singapore, Columbia was using R&T, a Singapore law prac tic e. I do not know if and to what extent R&T was liaising with TMAL on the Singapore proc eedings. Assuming that TMAL was liaising with R&T to some extent, would the Hongs be liable to Columbia for the fees of TMAL in addition to their liability for Columbia’s c osts in appointing R&T (and even then only on a party and party basis)? While it may be natural for Columbia to have the c omfort of advic e from external Malaysian lawyers to advise them on the work of R&T and to c o-ordinate with R&T, it would be surprising if Columbia were to c laim both the c osts of appointing TMAL and R&T from the Hongs for the Singapore proc eedings. Therefore, in princ iple, Columbia is not entitled to c laim for Kusnandar’s fees for c ollaborating with Hiswara (and the Notary Public ) and MC Kaban. Likewise, Columbia is not entitled to c laim Kusnandar’s fees for overseeing the efforts of the Hongs to disc harge the MEC c harge. 

55     Columbia initially submitted that the sub-total of Kusnandar’s fees for c ollaborating with Hiswara 

was US$74,843.35. [note: 5] Subsequently, Columbia submitted that the ac tual sub-total should be 

US$70,610.79 while the Hongs submitted that it should be US$74,843.35. [note: 6] The differenc e is US$4,232.56. This US$4,232.56 is derived from an invoic e (Number 034/11 dated 12 August 2011) 

whic h is for the total amount of US$7,432.56. [note: 7] The relevant sum of US$4,232.56 inc ludes US$3,625 for exploration by Kusnandar of all options inc luding approac hing the Medan land offic e. The balanc e of US$607.56 is attributed to disbursements for translation fees, out-of-poc ket expenses, a deduc tion for 2% withholding tax and an addition of Value Added Tax of 10%. It appears that Columbia made an error in its initial submission and the US$3,625 should not have been inc luded as a deduc tion. The amount was for Kusnandar’s work _vis-à-vis_ the Medan land offic e. As for the balanc e of US$607.56, I will divide it equally between Columbia and the Hongs sinc e the US$3,625 is roughly half of the total amount c laimed in the invoic e. Half of US$607.56 is US$303.78. The total sum to be deduc ted for this sub-c ategory is therefore US$70,610.79 plus US$303.78, whic h is US$70,914.57. 

56     Columbia initially submitted that the sub-total of Kusnandar’s fees for c ollaborating with MC 

Kaban was US$20,671.20. [note: 8] Subsequently, Columbia submitted that the ac tual sub-total should be US$15,079 while the Hongs submitted that it should be US$20,671.20. The differenc e is US$5,592.20. The US$5,592.20 is derived from an invoic e (Number 013/12 dated 26 April 2012) for 

the total sum of US$12,517.20. [note: 9] This sum of US$5,592.20 inc luded US$4,550 for various 


disc ussions with the assistant of the Head of the legal department of the Central Land Offic e and US$1,042.20 for disbursements and a deduc tion for 2% withholding tax and an addition of Value Added Tax of 10%. For similar reasons as stated above at [55], I will not deduc t the US$4,550. As for the balanc e of US$1,042.20, I will apportion it between the Hongs and Columbia (or PTNM) sinc e the Hongs are liable for only US$4,550 of the princ ipal sums in that invoic e. Sinc e US$4,550 is about 40% of the princ ipal sums c laimed in that invoic e for fees, the amount of the disbursements and taxes for whic h the Hongs are liable is US$416.88 ( _ie_ , 40% of US$1,042.20). The remaining US$625.32 ( _ie_ , 60% of US$1,042.20) is to be deduc ted. The total sum to be deduc ted for this sub-c ategory is therefore US$15,079 plus US$625.32, whic h is US$15,704.32. 

57     As for Kusnandar’s fees for c ollaborating with R&T insofar as R&T was giving advic e about the exec ution of a disc harge doc ument, suc h advic e was appropriately given by a Singapore law prac tic e sinc e MEC was a Singapore c ompany. It was also appropriately c onsidered by Kusnandar as the MEC c harge was registered in Indonesia and Kusnandar was doing the work to obtain the disc harge. I am therefore of the view that the Hongs are liable in princ iple for Kusnandar’s fees in c ollaborating with R&T on that advic e. 

58     Therefore, Kusnandar’s fees are reduc ed as follows for further c onsideration: 

 Sum claimed: US$183,261. 

 Less: US$3,150. (see [51] above) 

 Less: US$70,914. (see [55] above) 

 Less: US$15,704. (see [56] above) 

 Total: US$93,493. 

59     As mentioned above, it is still for Columbia to establish the reasonable amount the Hongs are liable for. I do not think a nominal sum would suffic e as substantial work was done. However, details of the lawyers involved and time spent were not supported by sourc e doc uments. Furthermore, there was no oral elaboration as to why so muc h work had to be done. In the absenc e of more evidenc e, I will allow Columbia to c laim 50% of US$93,493.01, _ie_ , US$46,746.51. 

**_MC Kaban_** 

60     PTNM had instruc ted MC Kaban to assist in proc uring the disc harge of the MEC c harge. It is not in dispute that MC Kaban suc c eeded in doing so where others had failed. 

61     Columbia’s c laim for MC Kaban’s fees is set out in the table at [3] above. The c laim is based on 

a Suc c ess Fee Agreement dated 23 February 2012 whic h was exhibited in Aw’s AEIC. [note: 10] As I will elaborate later, there was also another Suc c ess Fee Agreement whic h Columbia submitted was 


the first agreement whic h was then superc eded by the one exhibited in Aw’s AEIC. I will therefore refer to the other Suc c ess Fee Agreement as “the 1st SFA” and the one exhibited in Aw’s AEIC as “the 2nd SFA”. I will also refer to both agreements c ollec tively as “the SFAs” or “two SFAs”. 

62     The 2nd SFA was signed by Ravi Raj Sivaraj, a Vic ePresident Direc tor of PTNM, and Sumiaty, a Financ e Manager of PTNM, for and on behalf of PTNM, and Marc os Confery Kaban, on behalf of MC Kaban. Neither one of these three signatories was produc ed by Columbia as a witness. Although there 

was evidenc e by way of a letter dated 19 August 2015 [note: 11] from MC Kaban that Mr Kaban refused to attend before this c ourt for the assessment hearing, no evidenc e was tendered to establish that both the signatories from PTNM had likewise refused. 

63     The Hongs objec ted to the admissibility of the 2nd SFA as evidenc e. They submitted that Columbia was not entitled to rely on s 32(1)( _j_ )(iv) of the EA to admit the 2nd SFA. This provision states: 

 Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant 

 32.—(1) Subjec t to subsec tions (2) and (3), statements of relevant fac ts made by a person (whether orally, in a doc ument or otherwise), are themselves relevant fac ts in the following c ases: 

 ... 

 or is made by person who is dead or who cannot be produced as witness; 

 ( j ) when the statement is made by a person in respec t of whom it is shown — 

 (i) ... 

 (ii) ... 

 (iii) ... 

 (iv) that, being c ompetent but not c ompellable to give evidenc e on behalf of the party desiring to give the statement in evidenc e, he refuses to do so; 

 ... 

64     The Hongs submitted that MC Kaban’s letter dated 19 August 2015 was not an outright refusal to give evidenc e but merely a statement that Mr Kaban was unwilling to give evidenc e and therefore reluc tant. If further steps had been taken to persuade him, he might have reversed his dec ision. 

65     I am of the view that the Hongs were splitting hairs when they submitted that the letter was not an outright refusal. It was c lear from the letter that Mr Kaban had refused to c ome as a witness. 

66     Whether Mr Kaban c ould have been persuaded to c ome as a witness if more effort had been put in to persuade him was a separate argument whic h did not c hange the fac t that Mr Kaban had refused to give evidenc e, thereby satisfying the requirements of s 32(1)( _j_ )(iv) of the EA. 

67     In any event, Columbia submitted that its primary position was that the 2nd SFA be admitted 


under s 32(1)( _b_ )(iv) and not s 32(1)( _j_ )(iv) of the EA. I have set out s 32(1)( _b_ )(iv) in the c ontext of Kusnandar’s invoic es (see [19] above). Columbia submitted that the 2nd SFA forms part of PTNM’s business rec ords. I add that _prima facie_ , the 2nd SFA c ould also be part of the business rec ords of MC Kaban. 

68     However, the next argument of the Hongs was based on s 32(3) of the EA, _ie_ , that there was so muc h unc ertainty or c onfusion over the 2nd SFA that it would not be in the interest of justic e to treat it as relevant and henc e admissible in evidenc e. This argument requires a more c areful c onsideration of the evidenc e from Columbia. 

69     Aw’s AEIC mentioned: 

 (a) an initial agreement for a suc c ess fee of IDR 2bn to be paid to MC Kaban if it managed to remove the MEC c harge (at para 136); 

 (b) an initial payment of IDR300m to MC Kaban for its operating expenses (at para 138); and 

 (c ) an eventual agreement for a suc c ess fee of IDR1.7bn, on top of the IDR300m already paid to MC Kaban (at para 139). 

70     As mentioned above, Aw’s AEIC referred to and exhibited one Suc c ess Fee Agreement only whic h I have referred to as the 2nd SFA. 

71     As it turned out, there was another Suc c ess Fee Agreement also dated 23 February 2012 

signed by the same signatories whic h was not exhibited in Aw’s AEIC. [note: 12] I have referred to this agreement as the 1st SFA. There was also a third doc ument entitled “Statement Letter” dated 

4 January 2013 whic h was apparently signed by the same signatories. [note: 13] 

72     I will deal with the two SFAs first. Ac c ording to Columbia, the 1st SFA was the earlier version of the two. The 1st SFA referred to the servic es of MC Kaban to sec ure “the write-off-right of land use” of PTNM for a hospital and provided for a suc c ess fee of IDR2bn. It also stated that if PTNM dec ided unilaterally not to use the servic es of MC Kaban “in the proc ess of obtaining the write-off” after the signing of the agreement, then MC Kaban was entitled to a suc c ess fee of IDR1.5bn. It is not c lear to me what the “write-off-right of land use” referred to. The Indonesian version used the word “Raya” and there was some evidenc e that “Raya” refers to the removal of a c harge. Even assuming that the 1st SFA was for the servic es of MC Kaban to remove the MEC c harge on a suc c ess fee basis, there was no explanation why MC Kaban should be entitled to IDR1.5bn if PTNM dec ided to terminate the engagement. 

73     Columbia submitted that the 2nd SFA exhibited in Aw’s AEIC was the later of the two versions. In this version, the servic es of MC Kaban were in respec t of both a “Raya”, apparently meaning the removal of a c harge, _and_ the extension of the Certific ate of Building Permit (“the CBP”) for a total suc c ess fee of IDR1.7bn. The 2nd SFA also provided that if PTNM were to terminate the servic es of MC Kaban in handling the extension of the CBP, then MC Kaban would rec eive a suc c ess fee of IDR1.5bn. Columbia submitted that the differenc e between the IDR2bn figure in the 1st SFA and the IDR1.7bn figure in the 2nd SFA was bec ause IDR300m had already been paid to MC Kaban as an advanc e payment for operating expenses. 

74     However, Aw c ould not explain why there were two SFAs under c ross-examination. [note: 14] Counsel for Columbia suggested during the trial that the explanation was in Aw’s AEIC. But if this were true, then Aw should have been able to repeat the explanation under c ross-examination, espec ially 


sinc e he is a qualified lawyer. I have referred above (at [69]) to the relevant paragraphs of Aw’s AEIC and I will now elaborate on them. 

75     Aw’s referenc e (at para 136 of his AEIC) to an initial agreement for a suc c ess fee of IDR2bn was in fac t to an oral agreement he had had with the two signatories of PTNM. It was not a referenc e to a formal written agreement between PTNM and MC Kaban. Furthermore, the 1st SFA was not exhibited in his AEIC. When one reads his AEIC, one gets the impression that there was only one SFA and not two. I reiterate that Aw c ould not explain why there were two SFAs. He even testified that he was not involved in either of the two SFAs even though he had stated in his AEIC that he had agreed to the IDR2bn figure with the two signatories of PTNM. In my view, Columbia's submission on the two SFAs was an attempt to give evidenc e from the bar. 

76     I add that even Columbia’s explanation, by way of submission, on the SFAs was not logic al. If the total fees payable to MC Kaban was IDR2bn (inc lusive of the IDR300m already paid), why was there a need for a sec ond agreement mentioning IDR1.7bn instead of IDR2bn? The fac t of an advanc e payment does not c hange the total amount agreed to be paid to MC Kaban. Sec ondly, the 2nd SFA mentioning the IDR1.7bn figure did not mention the advanc e payment of IDR300m. This should have been done if in fac t the total fee was IDR2bn. Thirdly, why were the SFAs both dated the same day? It seemed illogic al that after signing one agreement, the parties then signed another one the very same day for a different figure without mentioning the advanc e payment of IDR300m. 

77     It is also important to bear in mind that the 2nd SFA referred not only to the removal of a c harge but also to the extension of the CBP. The Hongs are not liable for the c osts of the latter. 

78     Furthermore, Aw’s AEIC did not refer to the Statement Letter whic h stipulated a payment of IDR700m “for the extension of building rights”, whic h apparently was the same thing as the extension of the CBP. Neither c ould he explain how this doc ument applied in view of the two SFAs. 

79     Columbia was c ontent to submit that the Statement Letter affirmed the revision of the two versions of the SFA, and that the suc c ess fee of IDR700m was for the renewal of the “building rights” (or CBP). However, the Statement Letter still did not explain what this “extension of building rights” referred to. If, under the Statement Letter, MC Kaban was entitled to IDR700m for that extension, then this would mean that the suc c ess fee for removing the MEC c harge would be IDR1.3bn, _ie_ , IDR2bn less IDR700m. Yet, Columbia still c laimed IDR2bn for the removal of the MEC c harge. 

80     In view of the existenc e of these three doc uments and the absenc e of a reasonable explanation for them from any of the signatories, I am of the view that it would not be in the interest of justic e to allow either of the SFAs or the Statement Letter to be admitted into evidenc e. 

81     This means that while I ac c ept that Columbia did pay something to MC Kaban for its servic es in removing the MEC c harge, there is insuffic ient evidenc e as to the agreed amount of the suc c ess fee for this task. Although there were some payment vouc hers from PTNM in respec t of various payments totalling IDR2bn to MC Kaban, it is not entirely c lear what they were for. Moreover, no invoic e from MC Kaban was produc ed and the rec eipts from MC Kaban were also general in terms. 

82     The Hongs submitted that a reasonable amount for the fees of MC Kaban to sec ure the removal of the MEC c harge would be IDR50m. I presume that this submission was made bec ause this was the figure that the Hongs had themselves agreed with their own Indonesian lawyer on a suc c ess fee basis. However, this fee was agreed on muc h earlier – soon after the c ompletion of the SSA. Bearing in mind that MC Kaban c ame into the pic ture only after a number of years of futile attempts by Kusnandar and Columbia, I am of the view that it is likely that PTNM agreed to a higher figure, 


espec ially sinc e it must have been more desperate by then. Columbia argues that the agreed suc c ess fee was IDR2bn, but there is insuffic ient evidenc e to establish that there was an agreement for this amount. I nevertheless agree that the agreed amount is likely to have been muc h more than IDR50m. In the absenc e of more evidenc e, I will fix this figure at IDR100m. Based on the c onversion rate used in the table at [3] above, this amount of IDR100m would be more than US$10,000. 

**_R&T’s fees_** 

83     R&T’s fees were for work in respec t of two areas. The first was a c laim against GS and the sec ond was an advic e given in respec t of the exec ution of a disc harge instrument to remove the MEC c harge. I have referred to the latter in the c ontext of Kusnandar’s c laim for the fees it c harged in relation to its c ollaboration with R&T (at [49] above). 

84     R&T’s breakdown for the first piec e of work amounted to $13,137.30. [note: 15] The main bulk of the work done was in drafting a statement of c laim against GS to pressure GS to use its own Indonesian lawyers Hiswara (and the Notary Public ) to get the MEC c harge removed. I have mentioned this already in the c ontext of Kusnandar’s fees, as Kusnandar had to oversee and c omment on the work of Hiswara (see [45] above). I will not allow this c laim for R&T’s fees for several reasons. 

85     First, as already mentioned, Kusnandar did not rec ommend the use of Hiswara and in fac t had reservations about this avenue of ac tion. Therefore, I am of the view that the Hongs should not be liable for the work done by R&T in drafting the statement of c laim in order to pressure GS to obtain Hiswara’s assistanc e. 

86     Sec ondly, I do not think that the Hongs should be liable for R&T’s work done in drafting the statement of c laim. Let me elaborate. 

87     I apprec iate that Columbia wanted to put pressure on GS to render assistanc e but was it reasonable to do so by means of drafting a statement of c laim? True, it c ould be argued that the statement of c laim served its purpose as GS eventually agreed to render assistanc e. However, it c ould also be argued that GS would have rendered its assistanc e in any event. 

88     Even if the former situation were true, I am of the view that it was unlikely that there was a valid c laim in the first plac e. While GS agreed to release all its interests in any outstanding loan, GS did not agree to be responsible for disc harging the MEC c harge whic h it did not c reate. The MEC c harge was in favour of MEC not GS. In the absenc e of more evidenc e, it was unlikely that GS had undertaken the responsibility of removing the MEC c harge in addition to agreeing to release all its interests in any outstanding loan. 

89     I am of the view that it is likely that R&T would have been aware of the hurdle Columbia would fac e in prosec uting the c laim against GS. The reason for the statement of c laim was an extra-legal one, _ie_ , to put pressure on GS. The Hongs should not be liable for the work done in pursuing this extra-legal rationale. I add that, had the c laim been pursued and dismissed, Columbia would not have been entitled to c laim from the Hongs the party-to-party c osts it would have had to pay to GS. 

90     I also note that the last item in the breakdown of $13,137.30 was for $1,300. [note: 16] This was for a disc ussion on further and better partic ulars requested by the Hongs and for other work. Suc h partic ulars seemed to pertain to the three suits and not to the removal of the MEC c harge as suc h. I would have disallowed this item or part of it even if I was minded to allow the c laim for the work done by R&T in drafting the statement of c laim against GS. 


 For Kusnandar’s fees US$46,746. 

 For MC Kaban’s fees IDR100,000,000. 

 For R&T’s fees S$1, 

91     I now c ome to R&T’s advic e to Kusnandar in respec t of the exec ution of a disc harge instrument to remove the MEC c harge. It will be remembered that one of the questions whic h arose, when Kusnandar was trying to get the MEC c harge removed, was whether someone c ould sign a disc harge instrument for MEC to disc harge the MEC c harge. R&T’s fees in relation to this issue amounted to $4,960. The breakdown for this amount tendered by Aw referred to “Setting advic e” with a date of 

17 June 2011 and another item of the same nature dated 20 June 2011. [note: 17] In fac t, there was 

only one piec e of written advic e whic h was dated 20 June 2011. [note: 18] The fee for this written advic e was $1,200. As for the former, R&T c larified that this was not a _separate_ piec e of written advic e but was work done for the written advic e dated 20 June 2011. The fee for this work was $2,400. The written advic e was a rather lengthy one whic h inc luded a detailed rec itation of the history of events. This rec itation, in my view, was not nec essary as Columbia and Kusnandar were aware of the history. The c rux of the advic e was whether the Offic ial Rec eiver would sign a disc harge instrument on behalf of MEC and that was found at the end of the opinion. There were also three other items totalling $1,360, whic h was part of the $4,960. These were for reviewing a memo prepared by a junior lawyer and internal disc ussions. As the written advic e was relatively straight forward, I am of the view that the Hongs should be liable for $1,100 only, whic h inc ludes disbursements and GST for that advic e. 

**_TMAL’s fees_** 

92     Columbia also c laim the fees of its external Malaysian lawyers TMAL. As mentioned above, I understand why Columbia would want its external Malaysian lawyers to oversee the work of lawyers in other jurisdic tions and advise Columbia on suc h work. However, that is not an aspec t whic h the Hongs should be liable for. I dismiss Columbia’s c laim for suc h fees. 

**Summary** 

93     In summary, the Hongs are to pay the following to Columbia as the reasonable c osts for work done to remove the MEC c harge: 

94     Parties are at liberty to agree to payment in any c urrenc y at suc h exc hange rates as may be ac c eptable to them. If there is diffic ulty in payment or rec eipt in any of the above c urrenc ies, I grant the parties liberty to apply by letter to this c ourt to determine an alternative c urrenc y at an exc hange rate also to be determined by this c ourt. 

**Costs** 

95     I will hear the parties on the c osts of the assessment hearing.
