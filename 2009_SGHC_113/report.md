_Contract_ 

7 May 2009 

**Lai Siu Chiu J:** 

1       This was a c laim for a sum of US$1,623,346.40 allegedly owed by Kamalraj Johnson and Hephzibha Joybell Kamalraj (“the defendants”) to Watc hdata Tec hnologies Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”) under a deed of guarantee. At the c onc lusion of the trial, I found for the plaintiff. The defendants have now appealed against my judgment (in Civil Appeal No. 196 of 2008). 

**The facts** 

2       The plaintiff is a Singapore c ompany whic h is a supplier and distributor of Subsc riber Identity Module c ards (“SIM c ards”) and has been in business sinc e 2000. The defendants, who are husband (“the first defendant”) and wife (“the sec ond defendant”), are direc tors and majority shareholders of a loc ally inc orporated c ompany c alled Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited (“the Singapore Company”). There is a third shareholder of the Singapore Company, one Christina Lim Ser Ling. The Singapore Company provides supplies and servic es to telec ommunic ations operators in India. 

3       The defendants are also majority shareholders and direc tors of a c ompany in India c alled Sharon Solutions (India) Private Limited (“the India Company”). Sinc e 20 May 2005, one Uma Maheswari (“Uma”) was another direc tor and shareholder of the India Company. 

4       Many aspec ts of the parties’ c ourse of dealings were disputed and thus we need to look at the available doc umentation. During the period from 23 April 2004 to 23 February 2006, the Singapore Company issued SIM c ard purc hase orders signed by the first defendant as authorized signatory and ac c epted by the plaintiff (“the SGS Purc hase Orders”). The first SGS Purc hase Order dated 23 April 2004 reads as follows: 

 M/s Watc hdata Tec hnologies Pte Ltd

 Kindly arrange to c onfirm the above. 

From 30 November 2004 onwards, the SGS Purc hase Orders generally did not make referenc e to the “India operations”. 

5       Several invoic es issued by the plaintiff from 2004 to 2006 were also exhibited (“the plaintiff’s invoic es”). The invoic es issued in 2004 were eac h labelled “Commerc ial Invoic e”. There was a c olumn labelled “Forwarding address/ Markings” and a c olumn for “Mode of Shipment”, as well as c olumns for the desc ription of goods, quantity, unit pric e and total pric e. In 2005, the format of the invoic es c hanged. They were eac h labelled “Tax Invoic e” and c ontained the plaintiff’s Goods and Servic es Tax (“GST”) Registration Number. There was a c olumn labelled “Bill to” and another c olumn labelled “Ship to”, as well as the c olumns for the desc ription of goods, quantity, unit pric e and total pric e. In general, the 2004 invoic es c ontained the Pondic herry address of the India Company under the “Forwarding address/Markings” c olumn (“the 2004 India invoic es”) whereas from 2005 onwards, they c ontained the Singapore Company’s address in the “Bill to” c olumn and the India Company’s address in the “Ship to” c olumn. 

6       The plaintiff and the Singapore Company entered into a supply agreement dated 14 July 2004 (“the Supply Agreement”) for the sale and purc hase of SIM c ards. Artic le 1 of the Supply Agreement set out its sc ope as follows:

 ... 

 ARTICLE 12 – PAYMENT TERMS 

 ... 

 12.2 There is a US$100,000 c redit limit for SGS. At any time, the outstanding payment should not be higher than this c redit limit. 

 ... 

By virtue of Artic le 4, the Supply Agreement expired one year after its signature date ( _ie_ , on 13 July 2005). 

8       On 12 June 2006, the first defendant on behalf of the Singapore Company and the managingdirec tor of the plaintiff Yu Zhilu (“Yu”) signed a doc ument entitled “Agreement to settle the outstanding issues between Watc hdata Tec hnologies Private Limited, Singapore and Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited, Singapore”. The agreement stated: 

 It has been agreed to resolve the pending payment issues between both the parties on the supply of c ards to Indian Market. 

 The disc ussions and settlement issues are as follows: 

 It has now been agreed that every month starting from June 2006 onwards Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited, Singapore will remit a minimum of US$200K per month till the liabilities are extinguished; 

 Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited is expec ted to c lear US$500K by 15th July 2006 and Watc hdata Tec hnologies Private Limited, Singapore is expec ted to c ontinue their support; 

 The outstanding liability will be rec onc iled and settled on or before 31st Dec ember 2006... 

9       Shortly thereafter, on 29 June 2006, the defendants signed under seal a deed of guarantee (“the Personal Guarantee”). This was an important doc ument. Its key terms were as follows: 

1\. This deed of guarantee (this “Guarantee”) is made on 29th day of June 2006. 

2\. Kamalraj Johnson [ _ie_ , the first defendant]... and Hephzibha Joybell Kamalraj [ _ie_ , the sec ond defendant]... agree to be the guarantors for and on behalf of Sharon Global Solutions Private     Limited [ _ie_ , the Singapore Company]... if in c ase Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited (“Sharon”) fails to extinguish the liability in full to Watc hdata Tec hnologies Private Limited (“WDT”) [ _ie_ , the plaintiff] on or before 31st Dec ember 2006. 

3\. Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited owes the amount of USD 2,114,846-40 as on the date of this Deed (subjec t to the variation of not more than USD 120,000 upon submission of doc umentary proof of evidenc ing the payment to WDT) (the “Amount Due”). 

4\. In c onsideration of WDT granting time to Sharon to pay the Amount Due and not enforc ing its 


 legal rights, thereof, the Guarantors expressly agree and undertake to step in to pay liquidate the Amount Due or any part thereof as the outstanding dues of Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited if any, in the event the Amount Due remains not fully paid by 31 Dec ember 2006. 

5\. This guarantee is a c ontinuing guarantee till the liability of Sharon to WDT is fully and finally settled and the Guarantors’ liability, under it are [ _sic_ ] joint and several. 

 ... 

 [emphasis added] 

10     It was not disputed that after the Personal Guarantee was signed the plaintiff did not supply SIM c ards to the Singapore Company exc ept for a single order for whic h payment was rec eived in full before delivery in September 2006. Instead, supplies were made to the India Company for whic h advanc e payment was made before delivery. 

11     On February 2007, Yu (on behalf of the plaintiff ) and the defendants (on behalf of the India Company) signed a memorandum of understanding (“the 15 February 2007 MOU”). The relevant terms were as follows: 

 1) This teaming agreement will c ome into forc e as and when the formalities are finalized.

12     The plaintiff and the India Company entered into a few more agreements subsequently. On 17 Marc h 2007, Yu (on behalf of the plaintiff ) and the first defendant (on behalf of the India Company) signed a c ooperation agreement (“the Cooperation Agreement”). The relevant terms of the Cooperation Agreement were as follows:

13     The plaintiff c alled on the Personal Guarantee by a letter of demand dated 8 August 2007. Based on the plaintiff’s ac c ounts, the Singapore Company had made payments amounting to US$491,500 sinc e the date of the Personal Guarantee. The last payment made by the Singapore Company was on 3 July 2007. Henc e, the amount due and outstanding to the plaintiff was US$1,623,346.40. The defendants failed to make payment and the plaintiff filed the writ of summons herein on 7 September 2007. 

**The pleadings** 

14     The pleadings of both parties were eac h amended a few times before the trial c ommenc ed. In its latest statement of c laim [“Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2”], the plaintiff c laimed that the defendants were liable to pay the plaintiff US$1,623,346.40 pursuant to the Personal Guarantee. The plaintiff c ontended that the defendants had guaranteed the princ ipal debt owed by the Singapore Company to the plaintiff under the SGS Purc hase Orders, whic h c onstituted written c ontrac ts between the plaintiff and the Singapore Company in respec t of the SIM c ards supplied under the respec tive SGS Purc hase Orders. 

15     The plaintiff averred that it would only c ommenc e produc tion of the SIM c ards after it rec eived what is known as an “input file” from the Singapore Company (whic h in turn obtained it from Indian telec ommunic ations operators), c ontaining the quantity of SIM c ards to be manufac tured and desc riptions of the c ustomisation required for the SIM c ards in a given purc hase order. After manufac turing the SIM c ards in ac c ordanc e with the input files, the plaintiff would then deliver the SIM c ards to a plac e designated by the Singapore Company. Eac h time that delivery of SIM c ards was made, the plaintiff would issue an invoic e in respec t of that delivery. The quantity stated in any one purc hase order might be supplied in several batc hes over a period of time, _ie_ , there c ould be one or more input files c orresponding to eac h purc hase order. On some oc c asions, the plaintiff and defendants would agree that the plaintiff supply less than the quantity stated in an input file. On suc h oc c asions, the Singapore Company would be c harged for only the quantity ac tually supplied. 

16     The plaintiff annexed to its Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) a table (“Sc hedule 2”) whic h set out the plaintiff’s invoic es and showed whic h SGS Purc hase Orders they were issued in respec t of, and the spec ific payments made by the Singapore Company to the plaintiff in respec t of those invoic es. Payments whic h were not made spec ific ally towards any partic ular invoic e were designated as “general payment” and also deduc ted from the balanc e in Sc hedule 2. The final balanc e in Sc hedule 2 showed an outstanding debt of US$1,623,346.40 owed by the Singapore Company as at 


3 July 2007. The plaintiff also annexed a statement of ac c ounts (“Sc hedule 3”) whic h utilised the “first in first out” (“FIFO”) ac c ounting system ( _ie_ , payments made by the Singapore Company were used to pay off the earliest invoic es first, rather than being attributed to spec ific invoic es). The amount outstanding under Sc hedule 3 was also US$1,623,346.60 as of 3 July 2007. 

17     The plaintiff averred that the 2004 India invoic es were addressed by error to the India Company whenever the plac e designated by the Singapore Company for delivery was in India. The plaintiff maintained that all invoic es issued were sent to the Singapore Company for payment, and that the c ontrac ting parties remained at all material times the plaintiff and the Singapore Company pursuant to the SGS Purc hase Orders. 

18     The plaintiff ac knowledged that in addition to written c ontrac ts in the form of the SGS Purc hase Orders, it had also entered into the Supply Agreement with the Singapore Company. Its position was that insofar as the SGS Purc hase Orders were issued during the term of the Supply Agreement, the terms of the Supply Agreement applied to the SGS Purc hase Orders. 

19     In their latest defenc e filed on 28 July 2008 [“Defenc e (Amendment No 3”)], the defendants denied that the SGS Purc hase Orders c onstituted written c ontrac ts between the plaintiff and the Singapore Company and put the plaintiff to stric t proof that the dealings between the plaintiff and the Singapore Company were as has been detailed in [15] above. 

20     The defendants c ontended that the Supply Agreement was a separate and distinc t c ontrac t from the SGS Purc hase Orders and that the Singapore Company had entered into the Supply Agreement as agents for the India Company. 

21     The defendants admitted giving the Personal Guarantee and also admitted that the sum of US$2,114,864.40 was referred to therein. However, they maintained that if at all they were liable as guarantors, it was only in respec t of SIM c ards supplied under the Supply Agreement to the Singapore Company. They c ontended that as the plaintiff had admitted in para 3 of its original Statement of Claim filed on 7 September 2007 (“the original Statement of Claim”) that it was “[p]ursuant to the Supply Agreement [that] the plaintiff supplied SIM Cards to Sharon Global Solutions Private Limited”, the plaintiff was estopped from saying that the SIM c ards were supplied to the Singapore Company otherwise than under the Supply Agreement. 

22     The defendants also c ontended that all the sums due to the plaintiff for whic h the Personal Guarantee was given have been fully paid. 

23     The defendants further c ontended that there was no c onsideration moving from the plaintiff to support the alleged Personal Guarantee. In the alternative, the defendants c ontended that the c onsideration for the Personal Guarantee was past c onsideration. In the premises, they asserted that the Personal Guarantee was not binding on them. 

24     The defendants said that even if they were liable under the Personal Guarantee, they had been disc harged for a few reasons: first, the plaintiff had by the 15 February 2007 MOU extended the time of payment of any sum due from the India Company; and sec ondly, para 3(a) of the 15 February 2007 MOU stated that it was the India Company that owed the plaintiff US$1.8m and therefore the plaintiff had ac c epted the India Company as the princ ipal debtor in plac e of the Singapore Company. The defendants c ontended that they were not liable as guarantors of the debt owed by the India Company. 

25     The defendants c ontended that under artic le 19 of the Supply Agreement any dispute, 


c ontroversy or c laim arising out of the Supply Agreement should first be settled by arbitration and sinc e the plaintiff had not taken steps towards arbitration, it was not entitled to maintain the present ac tion against the defendants. 

26     The defendants also c ontended that by virtue of artic le 12.2 of the Supply Agreement, their liability (if it existed) should not exc eed US$100,000. 

27     Spec ific ally, the defendants c ontended that they were not liable in respec t of some 18 invoic es listed in Sc hedule 3 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) amounting to US$1,143,159.25 ( _viz_ , invoic es nos. 247, 251 to 253, 255 to 259, 261 to 262, 264 to 265, 267, 269 to 271 and 273), being invoic es for transac tions entered into prior to the Supply Agreement and also between the plaintiff and the India Company. 

28     The defendants also c ontended that they were not liable in respec t of some 33 invoic es listed in Sc hedule 3 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) amounting to US$1,143,159.25 ( _viz_ , invoic es nos. 276 to 279, 281 to 287, 289 to 291, 295 to 296, 303, 305, 310, 312, 314, 319 to 320, 323, 327, 329, 331 to 332, 337, 339, 342, 344 and 347) whic h, although issued for transac tions during the period of validity of the Supply Agreement, related to SIM c ards supplied to the India Company. 

29     The defendants further denied liability in respec t of the invoic es for SIM c ards supplied after the expiry of the Supply Agreement on 13 July 2005. 

30     In its Reply [“Reply (Amendment No 3)”], the plaintiff maintained that the sale of SIM c ards as represented by the invoic es set out in Sc hedule 2 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) was to the Singapore Company. The plaintiff essentially denied all the defendants’ c ontentions as detailed above. It made several other points in its Reply (Amendment No 3) worth noting. The plaintiff pointed out that the defendants’ position that the Singapore Company entered into the Supply Agreement as agents for the India Company c ontradic ted its position that it was only liable for the supplies made to the Singapore Company under the Supply Agreement. 

31     Further the plaintiff averred, the 15 February 2007 MOU was spec ific ally entered into only with the India Company as it was intended that, without affec ting the Personal Guarantee, it would give the plaintiff c onfidenc e that there was an additional avenue for it to obtain payment for the debts owed by the Singapore Company, the defendants personally and the India Company. It was not intended to grant either the defendants or the Singapore Company additional time to pay the debt. The plaintiff averred that the parties had agreed and it was at all material times c lear that the defendants remained obliged to repay the plaintiff after the 15 February 2007 MOU was signed. The plaintiff added that the 15 February 2007 MOU was not legally enforc eable as it would not c ome into forc e until the terms set out therein were finalised, whic h was never done. 

**The evidence** 

32     The plaintiff c alled eight witnesses to prove its c ase while the defendants and Uma testified for the defenc e. 

**_The plaintiff’s case_** 

33     The plaintiff’s first witness was Szeto Yan Chi Patric k (“Szeto”) who was the plaintiff’s Business Direc tor from January 2005 to September 2007. He gave evidenc e on the signing of the Cooperation Agreement and its aftermath. 


34     Szeto stated in his affidavit of evidenc e-in-c hief (“AEIC”) that he was asked by Yu to attend meetings with the first defendant in Chennai to disc uss the Cooperation Agreement that was eventually signed on 17 Marc h 2007. Szeto was in Chennai from 13 Marc h 2007 to 3 April 2007. In c ross-examination, he c larified that he had partic ipated in meetings held on 14, 15, 16 and 17 Marc h 2007. 

35     Szeto revealed that, in Chennai, the first defendant had frequently ( _viz_ , two to three times a day) asked Yu and one Wang You Jun (“Wang”) a direc tor of the Plaintiff (see [54] below) at the various meetings whether the Personal Guarantee c ould be disc harged as a result of the parties’ entering into the Cooperation Agreement. Both Yu and Wang spec ific ally said that they did not agree to the first defendant’s request. 

36     In partic ular, Szeto rec alled a meeting on 16 Marc h 2007 at whic h the partic ipants inc luded the defendants, Yu, Uma and himself. Ac c ording to Szeto, at this meeting, the first defendant again asked that the Personal Guarantee be disc harged and replac ed by the Cooperation Agreement. Yu c ategoric ally answered “no” and told the first defendant that the Personal Guarantee would be disc harged upon the plaintiff’s rec eipt of payment of the princ ipal debt in full. The first defendant appeared to agree to that. 

37     Szeto deposed that after the Cooperation Agreement was signed, he was tasked by the plaintiff with overseeing the operations of the India Company to see if the India Company had any assets to pay the Singapore Company’s debt. He asked Uma for the bank rec ords, Indian telec ommunic ation operators’ purc hase orders and other ac c ounting rec ords of the India Company but was not given any. He was also not given any authority to sign any c heques. Unable to do anything c onstruc tive, Szeto left India on 3 April 2007. He returned to India on 18 April 2007 but the situation did not improve. Uma only gave him some outdated bank statements whic h he exhibited in his AEIC. He returned to Singapore in midMay 2007. In c ross-examination, he stated that he was never appointed as a senior management staff of the India Company. When c ounsel for the defendants produc ed two letters addressed to the Federal Bank Limited, Chennai dated 28 Marc h 2007 and 4 April 2007 and signed by himself, Szeto said that he had been dec eived into signing those letters thinking that he had the authority to do so when in fac t his signature was ineffec tive. 

38     The plaintiff’s next witness was Andrew Teh (“Teh”), an employee of the plaintiff from 20 Oc tober 2004 to 31 January 2008. Teh (PW2) testified on the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding dated 20 Dec ember 2004 whic h was exhibited in an affidavit of the first defendant (“the 2004 MOU”) and whic h the defendants relied on as proof that the plaintiff knew that the India Company was the princ ipal for whom the Singapore Company was ac ting as agent in the supply of SIM c ards (see [60] below). Teh deposed that the 2004 MOU was not signed by him as the defendants alleged. He stated that the 2004 MOU c ould not be genuine for several reasons: first, the signature that appeared on the 2004 MOU whic h was allegedly his was not in fac t his. Sec ondly, although his title in the 2004 MOU was stated as “General Manager” he was in fac t only appointed as the plaintiff’s General Manager (Asia) with effec t from 1 January 2006. Thirdly, there would have been no reason for him to sign the 2004 MOU as in 2004, he was not managing the plaintiff’s telec ommunic ations produc ts nor did sales in India fall within the sc ope of his duties at that time. Fourthly, the 2004 MOU stated that the plaintiff’s c orporate address was at No. 10 Eunos Road 8 #12-05, Singapore Post Centre, but in Dec ember 2004 the Plaintiff’s registered address was in the OUB Centre and it was operating at Chai Chee Road. Finally, the defendants’ allegation that the 2004 MOU was in fac t signed by Teh on 20 Dec ember 2005 c ould not be true as Teh was in Manila on a business trip on 20 Dec ember 2005 (for whic h he exhibited his passport as proof). 

39     The subsequent witness for the plaintiff, Paul Westwood (“Westwood”) gave further evidenc e 


on the authentic ity of the 2004 MOU. Westwood (PW3) was a professional handwriting and doc ument examiner with 40 years of experienc e in his field. Pursuant to instruc tions from the plaintiff’s solic itors, he had undertaken an examination of a reproduc tion of the 2004 MOU (“Q1”) (whic h was provided by the India Company as the best available c opy of the doc ument), for the purpose of determining the genuineness or otherwise of Q1 and the 2004 MOU. Westwood was instruc ted to c onfine his examination to the genuineness of the first defendant’s signatures on Q1 (“the questioned signatures”). In his report, he observed that the remarkable degree of c oinc idenc e between various pair c ombinations of the questioned signatures with respec t to four disc rete stroke elements was far more than one would expec t in freely written signatures as c omplex as the questioned signatures. He c onc luded that his observations gave rise to serious doubt as to the genuineness of Q1 and the original 2004 MOU whic h it purported to represent. In c ross-examination, Westwood suggested that the slight differenc es whic h did exist between the questioned signatures might be a result of digital manipulation of the signatures. 

40     Another witness c alled by the plaintiff was Pessy Chan Pei Sze (“Pessy”), who was the plaintiff’s Senior Operation Exec utive in February 2007. Pessy (PW4) gave evidenc e on an e-mail allegedly sent by Uma to her on 15 February 2007 (“the 15 February 2007 e-mail”), authorising Pessy to deduc t “server payments” made by the India Company from the outstanding debt owed by the Singapore Company (and thus reduc ing the amount of debt owed by the Singapore Company). When she took the stand, Pessy stated that she c ould not rec all whether she had rec eived the 15 February 2007 e-mail but stated that if she had, she would have forwarded it to Mic hael (viz Yu who was known as Mic hael Yu in the plaintiff’s offic e). She c ould not rec all whether the e-mail had been disc ussed between herself and Yu. She c onfirmed that when Neo Jit Jit (“Neo”) (see [53] below) had asked her (by an e-mail dated 15 April 2008) whether she rec eived the 15 February 2007 e-mail, she had replied (also by way of an e-mail whic h was exhibited in Neo’s AEIC): “Not that I c an rec all...Btw, what is server payments?” 

41     The key witness for the plaintiff was Yu (PW5), who was/is also the president of the plaintiff. In his AEIC, Yu c onfirmed that the plaintiff’s mode of operations with respec t to the supply of SIM c ards to the Singapore Company beginning in 2004 was as pleaded above (in [15]). He deposed that the Supply Agreement merely enc apsulated the existing relationship between the plaintiff and the Singapore Company and put it on a formal footing. Yu stated that at the time the plaintiff entered into the Supply Agreement, it was only familiar with the Singapore Company. The defendants had informed Yu that the India Company was a substantial c ompany but Yu had his doubts, whic h was why the plaintiff only dealt with the Singapore Company. He deposed that the plaintiff did not “monitor” the Supply Agreement’s expiry date and c ontinued to supply SIM c ards to the Singapore Company even after the Supply Agreement expired based on purc hase orders issued by the Singapore Company. Thus, even though from the doc uments there appeared to be three relevant periods of supply ( _viz_ , the periods before, during and after the Supply Agreement), in ac tual fac t there was a seamless supply to the Singapore Company based on the SGS Purc hase Orders. 

42     Yu pointed out that the Singapore Company had ac knowledged that it was liable to pay under the plaintiff’s invoic es (whether c ontaining the name of the India Company or the Singapore Company) in its own statement of ac c ounts for 1 April 2004 to 31 Marc h 2005 (“the Singapore Company’s statement of ac c ounts”). The Singapore Company’s statement of ac c ounts inc luded the 2004 India invoic es. Furthermore, the sec ond defendant had signed (on behalf of the Singapore Company) audit c onfirmations for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 (“the audit c onfirmations”). By the audit c onfirmations, the defendants (on behalf of the Singapore Company) had agreed that the sums stated as owing from the Singapore Company, whic h matc hed the plaintiff’s statement of ac c ounts, was c orrec t. 


43     Yu deposed that the Singapore Company built up a substantial debt to the plaintiff for the supply of SIM c ards and by the end of 2005, he met with the defendants almost daily to try to resolve the situation. Yu wanted a sc hedule for all the arrears due to the plaintiff to be paid by instalments c oupled with a personal guarantee signed by the defendants, and asked the plaintiff’s solic itors to draft the personal guarantee. This led to the defendants’ signing of the 12 June 2006 agreement and, shortly thereafter, the Personal Guarantee. However, as at 31 Dec ember 2006, the defendants failed to c lear the outstanding debt. Yu therefore met the defendants a few times to disc uss the c learing of the outstanding debt. During one of these meetings, the first defendant informed Yu that he would use the India Company’s rec eivables to c lear the outstanding debt. Yu and the first defendant c ontinued intensive disc ussions during the period from January to Marc h 2007. Yu told the defendants that if they did not c lear the outstanding debt, the plaintiff had no c hoic e but to sue them on the Personal Guarantee. The first defendant then offered shares in the India Company as additional sec urity to the plaintiff. 

44     Yu deposed that the 15 February 2007 MOU was drafted by the defendants and himself. He c onfirmed that its purpose was as stated in the plaintiff’s Reply (Amendment No 3) (see [30] above). He stated that he did not ask the plaintiff’s solic itors to vet the 15 February 2007 MOU as it was not intended to be a legally binding doc ument. Yu said that he did not pay attention to the desc ription in the 15 February 2007 MOU of the persons who owed the debt to the plaintiff. Ac c ording to him, even at the time the 15 February 2007 MOU was signed, the defendants ac knowledged to him that they had a liability to pay under the Personal Guarantee and promised that they would settle the debt as soon as possible. 

45     Yu deposed that no payments were made by the defendants or the defendants’ c ompanies after the 15 February 2007 MOU and thus in Marc h 2007 he told the defendants that they should settle the outstanding debt due under the Personal Guarantee without further delay. The defendants then proposed that Yu visit the India Company so that he c ould see that it was a c redible c ompany and to see what arrangements c ould be made for payment of the outstanding debt. Yu visited India with Szeto in Marc h 2007, during whic h trip the Cooperation Agreement was signed. Yu stated that the Cooperation Agreement was merely a preparatory agreement to implement the monitoring of the India Company’s c ash flow so that the plaintiff c ould assess the financ ial position of the India Company, as it was envisaged in the 15 February 2007 MOU that the India Company would transfer 50% of its shares to the plaintiff as sec urity for the debt. In c ross-examination, he stated that although he had signed the Consent form to ac t as a direc tor dated 17 Marc h 2007, he never ac tually bec ame a direc tor of the India Company. 

46     Yu stated that at the time the terms of the Cooperation Agreement were being disc ussed, the first defendant wanted the plaintiff to disc harge the defendants from the Personal Guarantee by putting a c lause in the Cooperation Agreement to that effec t; Yu informed the first defendant that this was impossible and the latter ac c epted it. 

47     When he testified, Yu explained why the plaintiff had amended the Statement of Claim and the ac c ompanying statements of ac c ounts during the c ourse of the proc eedings. Ac c ording to him, the annexed statements of ac c ounts in the first Statement of Claim (whic h only listed the invoic es issued in 2005) were based on the FIFO ac c ounting princ iple. After using the payments from the Singapore Company to c lear the debt under the earliest invoic es, the balanc e invoic es happened to fall within the duration of the Supply Agreement. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed for summary judgment. In the c ourse of the hearings and pursuant to the judge’s direc tion (so that he c ould make a dec ision based on the fac e of the doc uments), the plaintiff amended the statement of ac c ounts to show every transac tion between the plaintiff and the Singapore Company beginning from 2004, using the running ac c ount method. However, the defendants then c laimed that the running ac c ount method should not 


be used bec ause some payments had been made in referenc e to spec ific invoic es. Henc e, the plaintiff amended the Statement of Claim again, adding a master statement of ac c ounts prepared by himself and Neo in whic h all spec ific payments were set off against the spec ific invoic es while the FIFO princ iple applied to non-spec ific payments ( _ie_ , Sc hedule 2 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2)). Yu pointed out that no matter whic h method was used, the same amount of debt owed by the defendants ( _viz_ , US$1,623,346.14) was obtained. 

48     Yu averred that he believed that the 15 February 2007 e-mail allegedly sent by Uma to Pessy was a fabric ated doc ument as it was usual for Pessy to forward to him e-mails whic h she rec eived, whic h had not been done in this instanc e. He had asked a third party expert to c hec k Pessy’s laptop for evidenc e of the e-mail and no trac e of it was found, although Yu also informed the c ourt that the expert had said this c ould not prove that the e-mail did not exist bec ause others had used the laptop after Pessy; thus, the hard disk might have already been affec ted. Yu stated that the plaintiff had never signed a server agreement with the India Company and thus rec eived those payments designated as “server” payments from the India Company as general payments to c lear the outstanding debt of the Singapore Company in respec t of the SIM c ards supplied. Those payments had already been reflec ted in Sc hedules 2 and 3 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2). 

49     Neo (PW6) was at the time of the trial the plaintiff’s operations manager. Neo deposed that in 2004 and 2005, the plaintiff rec eived payments for the SIM c ards supplied pursuant to the SGS Purc hase Orders as and when the Singapore Company dec ided to make payment. The plaintiff would alloc ate eac h payment rec eived to the earliest invoic es on a FIFO basis. Starting from 1 January 2006, the plaintiff required the Singapore Company to make advanc e payments for all the SIM c ards delivered that year. Apart from these advanc e payments, the defendants made additional payments in 2006 whic h, after applying the FIFO method, managed to satisfy the invoic es issued in 2004. This was why the statement of ac c ounts annexed to the original Statement of Claim only listed the invoic es for transac tions beginning from 2005. 

50     Neo deposed that on or about 12 Oc tober 2006, she met the sec ond defendant at the Singapore Company’s offic e for the purpose of rec onc iling the plaintiff’s ac c ounts with the Singapore Company’s ac c ounts. It was then that the sec ond defendant gave her a c opy of the Singapore Company’s statement of ac c ounts. Neo also pointed out that the sec ond defendant had signed the plaintiff’s audit c onfirmations for the financ ial years ended 2004, 2005 and 2006. Exc ept for the audit c onfirmation for the year ended 2004, the amounts in eac h of the audit c onfirmations matc hed the outstanding sums at the relevant dates in the plaintiff’s statement of ac c ounts. The amount stated in the audit c onfirmation for the year ended 2004 was slightly lower (by the sum of US$65.25) than the balanc e in the plaintiff’s statement of ac c ounts as at 31 Dec ember 2004 bec ause the plaintiff had bec ome GST-registered sinc e 13 Dec ember 2004 and the GST payable was by error not taken into ac c ount in the audit c onfirmation. 

51     Neo deposed that she had c aused searc hes to be done with the Registry of Companies to determine the registered address of the plaintiff in Dec ember 2004. She c onfirmed that in Dec ember 2004, the registered address of the plaintiff was at OUB Centre. She further deposed that the plaintiff’s operating address in Dec ember 2004 was Chai Chee Road and that the plaintiff only shifted to the Singapore Post Centre in July 2005. Copies of the lease agreements signed by the plaintiff in respec t of the premises at Chai Chee Road and Singapore Post Centre were exhibited in her AEIC. 

52     Neo deposed that in Dec ember 2004 there was only one rubber stamp for the plaintiff. She made two further rubber stamps in May 2006 whic h were identic al to the rubber stamp used in 2004. The first letter of eac h word in these rubber stamps was c apitalised and the rest of the letters were not. 


53     Neo stated that as Pessy was the most junior employee of the plaintiff, any e-mails sent by Uma would normally be sent to either Neo or another of the plaintiff’s employees, Tian Hui (see [55] below) and c opied to Pessy. Neo stated that she had c hec ked both her own and Tian’s c omputers and neither c omputer had any rec ord of the 15 February 2007 e-mail. Neo deposed that she had c alled Pessy and enquired about the e-mail. Pessy had orally and via e-mail c onfirmed that she was not aware of the 15 February 2007 e-mail. Neo exhibited a c opy of Pessy’s e-mail response whic h has already been set out above (at [40]). 

54     The next witness for the plaintiff was Wang You Jun (‘Wang”) a direc tor of the plaintiff. His evidenc e was somewhat c onfusing. In his AEIC Wang (PW7) averred that he was in India on 17 Marc h 2007 when the Cooperation Agreement was signed and that at the meeting the first defendant had asked that the defendants be disc harged from the Personal Guarantee. Yu who was also present at the meeting, rejec ted the request. In c ross-examination however, Wang said first, that no suc h request was made; then that there were two meetings, one in Pondic herry on 15 Marc h 2007and one in Chennai on 16 Marc h 2007 and he c ould not remember at whic h meeting the request was made; then later said he c ould not remember whether the first defendant ac tually made the request; and finally said that he had only heard of the request via the interpretation of Yu. 

55     The last witness for the plaintiff was Tian Hui (“Tian”), the tec hnic al c onsultant of the plaintiff from November 2003 to August 2006 and the plaintiff’s sales manager at the time of the trial. She deposed that she was the main person handling the ac c ount of the Singapore Company and c oordinated the deliveries of SIM c ards pursuant to the SGS Purc hase Orders. Ac c ording to Tian (PW8), the Singapore Company only had one ac c ount in respec t of the transac tions pursuant to the SGS Purc hase Orders and the ac c ount was with the Singapore Company. 

56     Tian deposed that she was the person who generated the plaintiff’s invoic es in 2004. She stated that the names and addresses under the “Forwarding address/Markings” c olumn in the invoic es were stated based solely on the loc ation to whic h the SIM c ards were being delivered, _ie_ , the addresses stated were shipping addresses. As far as she was aware, the plaintiff’s c ontrac tual relationship was with the Singapore Company and the invoic es were issued to the Singapore Company notwithstanding that they may have c ontained the name of the India Company in the “Forwarding address/Markings” c olumn. 

57     Tian also deposed that a memorandum of understanding (“the Al Hatim MOU”) whic h the defendants alleged had been signed by Teh on 20 Dec ember 2005 at the same time as the 2004 MOU was in fac t sent to her by the sec ond defendant by e-mail, signed by her on behalf of Teh and faxed bac k to the defendants. Tian exhibited the relevant e-mail c orrespondenc e in her AEIC. 

**_The defendants’ case_** 

58     The first defendant pointed out in his AEIC that Neo in an affidavit affirmed on 17 Marc h 2008 c lassified the plaintiff’s invoic es in three c ategories, of whic h the third c ategory c ontained 50 invoic es whic h she then averred related to invoic es for deliveries of SIM c ards to the India Company and for whic h payment was rec eived from the India Company 50 invoic es. He also pointed out several alleged disc repanc ies between the statement of ac c ounts attac hed to the plaintiff’s letter of demand dated 8 August 2007 and the statement of ac c ounts in the original statement of c laim. He also referred to other alleged admissions by the plaintiff’s witnesses inc luding by Neo, in an affidavit filed on 3 Dec ember 2007 where she stated (at para 24), that the plaintiff had supplied SIM c ards to the Singapore Company under the terms of the Supply Agreement, and by Yu in an affidavit filed on 3 Dec ember 2007 in whic h he stated that the purpose of the 15 February 2007 MOU with the India Company was to give the plaintiff more c onfidenc e that the debt to the plaintiff whic h “inc luded” the 


sum due from the Singapore Company would be repaid. 

59     The first defendant deposed that the India Company did c omply with the terms of the Cooperation Agreement. He averred that Yu was appointed direc tor of the India Company and produc ed doc uments to prove this inc luding an applic ation form for a provisional direc tor identific ation number (“DIN”) signed by Yu. He also averred that Szeto had been appointed as a senior management staff. The first defendant deposed that after obtaining the India Company’s c ustomer data, pric ing list and other sensitive information, Yu had registered a c ompany in India on 30 August 2007 on behalf of the plaintiff to c ompete with the India Company in the SIM c ard market for the same c ustomers. He suggested that this was the motive for the plaintiff’s c ommenc ement of this ac tion against the defendants. 

60     In c ross-examination, the first defendant maintained the position that the SGS Purc hase Orders were all plac ed by the Singapore Company on behalf of the India Company as agents, relying on the phrase “for our India operations” in the preamble of the purc hase orders issued in 2004. 

61     The first defendant stated that c opies of the plaintiff’s invoic es would be rec eived at the Singapore Company. However, he said that the material and c onsignment details as well as the original invoic es would be sent to the India Company and that as agent, the Singapore Company had a right to have the invoic es. When c ounsel for the plaintiff pointed out that the first defendant had inc luded in the list of invoic es allegedly due to be paid by the India Company (see his AEIC at [9] and [10]) invoic es in whic h the name and address in the “Forwarding address/ Markings” c olumn were the Singapore Company’s, his response was that his AEIC was wrong. 

62     In respec t of the Singapore Company’s statement of ac c ounts, the first defendant testified that it inc luded invoic es c ontaining the India Company’s name and address in “Forwarding address/Markings” c olumn bec ause the Singapore Company wanted to keep trac k of all the transac tions that took plac e between the plaintiff and the Singapore Company when the latter was ac ting as agent for the India Company. 

63     He ac c epted that he had not produc ed evidenc e of any instanc e where the Singapore Company ac ted as agent for the India Company; nor any written agenc y agreement between the Singapore Company and the India Company, nor had he given any evidenc e in his AEIC as to how an agenc y relationship c ame about between the two c ompanies. 

64     The first defendant ac c epted that the first SGS Purc hase Order c ontained all the information presc ribed in artic le 5.2 of the Supply Agreement (exc ept the desc ription of the produc ts being ordered and the address of plac e of delivery, whic h he ac knowledged were also not found in the purc hase orders sent during the period of Supply Agreement. 

65     He ac c epted that the Personal Guarantee c ontained no referenc e to the Supply Agreement and did not dispute that even during the term of the Supply Agreement, c ontrac ts for the supply of SIM c ards were formed only when the purc hase orders issued by the Singapore Company were ac c epted by the plaintiff, and that the Supply Agreement governed these individual c ontrac ts. 

66     The first defendant did not deny signing the Personal Guarantee and did not dispute that the plaintiff’s c onsideration for the Personal Guarantee was the granting of time to the Singapore Company to pay the outstanding debt. However, he maintained that the US$2,114,846.40 figure in the Personal Guarantee c overed debts owed by the Singapore Company and by the India Company. He alleged that no statement of ac c ounts was presented by the plaintiff at the time of the signing of the Personal Guarantee. He also stated that he had had no c hanc e to view the draft of the Personal 


Guarantee prior to the date of signing. 

67     In an apparent c ontradic tion of the pleaded Defenc e, the first defendant insisted that 15 February 2007 MOU did not amount to a transfer of debt and that his only position was that the debt was always payable only by the India Company. 

68     When it was pointed out to him that the c ontention that the defendants were disc harged under the Personal Guarantee by the extension of time for the payment of any sum due from the India Company implied that the defendants were liable for the debt of the India Company under the Personal Guarantee, the first defendant gave an ac c ount of the genesis of the 15 February 2007 MOU that was not present in his AEIC, _viz_ , that the defendants had signed the Personal Guarantee without the benefit of detailed ac c ounts as at that time they thought it was the Singapore Company whic h owed the debt to the plaintiff. Subsequently, after looking at the India Company’s ac c ounts, the defendants realised it was not the Singapore Company whic h owed the debt. They informed Yu of this and Yu then suggested signing 15 February 2007 MOU. 

69     When c ounsel for the plaintiff pointed out that c l 1(3) of the Cooperation Agreement meant that there was no agreement yet for even the transfer of shares in the India Company as envisaged by artic le 4 of the 15 Feb 2007 MOU, the first defendant’s response that this was bec ause there were exc hange c ontrol formalities to be c omplied with. The first defendant c laimed that the sec ond defendant and Uma had in fac t submitted their resignations as direc tors of the India Company and the India Company had started the proc ess for ac c eptanc e of the resignations, but ac c epted that no evidenc e had been produc ed to support this c laim. The first defendant ac knowledged that he had no proof that the applic ation form for a DIN signed by Yu was ac tually submitted. 

70     The first defendant testified that he did not mention the 2004 MOU in his AEIC bec ause it was a disputed doc ument. He denied that the questioned signatures were digital replic ations and stated that as he used to work as a banker his signature would be very uniform. It should be noted that when the first defendant first brought up the 2004 MOU in his affidavit filed on 26 Oc tober 2007 (in response to the plaintiff’s applic ation for a Mareva injunc tion), he gave no indic ation that the 2004 MOU was signed other than on 20 Dec ember 2004. In a subsequent affidavit filed on 13 November 2007 however, he stated that the 2004 MOU was ac tually signed on 20 Dec ember 2005 at the same time as the Al Hatim MOU by Teh who plac ed different rubber stamps on the two MOUs. Then in his affidavit filed on 19 August 2008, the first defendant shifted his position to state that the 2004 MOU was signed on 18 Dec ember 2005. 

71     The first defendant c laimed that he was c arbon-c opied the 15 February 2007 e-mail from Uma. He c laimed that he c ould not give proof of this as his c omputer was damaged stating (at N/E 353354): 

 In fac t that c omputer I have given to the – it was quite an old c omputer whic h was using and I – it fell down in the airc raft, and then, afterwards, I gave it to the c hurc h and it has gone to the c hurc h, and I c hanged my c omputer some time in this May. 

He also testified that he did not allow the c omputer expert to image Uma’s c omputer’s hard disk bec ause it was Uma’s personal c omputer and he was not authorised to let the expert do so. 

72     The sec ond witness foe the defenc e was the sec ond defendant. She admitted that she managed the operations of the Singapore Company from 2004 to 2007. However, she c laimed that she never maintained nor perused the Singapore Company’s ac c ounts, as she had very little knowledge of ac c ounting. 


73     The sec ond defendant desc ribed the SGS Purc hase Orders as non-binding “forec ast doc uments/orders”. She said that they c ould not be c onfirmed c ontrac ts bec ause they only c onfirmed the pric ing of the SIM c ards; the quantity, c onfiguration, artwork and sec urity information c ould only be c onfirmed when the input files c ame in. 

74     The sec ond defendant did not dispute that Neo had visited the Singapore Company’s offic e on 12 Oc tober 2006. However, she said that they did not disc uss or c arry out the rec onc iliation of the plaintiff’s and Singapore Company’s ac c ounts. She also testified that the Singapore Company’s statement was in fac t given by Neo to the Singapore Company’s ledger keeper and that she was not aware that the ledger keeper had given a c opy to Neo. 

75     The sec ond defendant testified that she had signed the audit c onfirmations without verifying the sum stated therein by referenc e to any statement of ac c ounts bec ause at that time the plaintiff and the Singapore Company enjoyed a good working relationship and she trusted the plaintiff to give the c orrec t figure. She c laimed she signed the audit c onfirmations under pressure from Neo that if she did not sign, the plaintiff would not honour the SGS Purc hase Orders. 

76     The sec ond defendant c onfirmed that the Singapore Company had rec eived invoic es sent by Tian in 2004 for shipments of SIM c ards. 

77     She testified that the defendants did not bother to c hec k the sum stated as owing under the Personal Guarantee against the Singapore Company’s ac c ounts again bec ause of the good working relationship with plaintiff. She c laimed that the Singapore Company only finalised its ac c ounts in January 2008. 

78     Ac c ording to the sec ond defendant, the first defendant had asked her to resign as direc tor of India Company but that resignation was not registered. She testified that the applic ation for joint ac c ount envisaged by artic le 8 of 15 February 2007 MOU was made, but the ac c ount was never ac tually opened and transac tions after the 15 February 2007 MOU for the supply of SIM c ards were not proc essed through a joint ac c ount. She ac knowledged that no shareholder agreement had been entered into for the transfer of the India Company’s shares as envisaged by the 15 February 2007 MOU. She maintained that the plaintiff’s c laim c ould not stand bec ause the India Company “took the debt” under the 15 February 2007 MOU. 

79     The sec ond defendant agreed that the Cooperation Agreement was for the purpose of undertaking due diligenc e on the India Company before there c ould be ac c eptanc e of the India Company’s shares that were being offered as c ollateral. 

80     The sec ond defendant revealed that she was not ac tually present when Teh allegedly turned up at the Singapore Company’s offic e and signed the 2004 MOU. When it was pointed out that in an affidavit jointly sworn by the defendants on 13 November 2007 the defendants had stated that Teh signed the 2004 MOU in both their presenc e, the sec ond defendant c laimed she c ould not remember whether the signing had taken plac e as averred. 

81     The defenc e’s final witness was Uma who bec ame an alternate direc tor of the India Company in 2005 and also owned 50,000 shares in the India Company. She was Assistant Vic ePresident of the India Company and in c harge of looking after its financ e and taxation matters. 

82     Uma testified that she had signed the Cooperation Agreement as a witness and was well aware of its terms. She said that the preamble referred to a debt owed by “Sharon Global Solutions... _and_ Sharon Solutions (India) Private Limited [emphasis added]” bec ause the Singapore Company ac ted on 


the India Company’s behalf as agents. She disagreed that the purpose of the Cooperation Agreement was to fac ilitate the plaintiff’s c onduc ting of due diligenc e on the India Company in order to dec ide whether to ac c ept the India Company’s shares as sec urity. 

83     Uma c onfirmed that she was the person who dealt with Szeto in respec t of disc losure of doc uments. She testified that she showed him the c onfidential doc uments kept in the India Company’s offic e in Chennai, inc luding purc hase orders, c ustomer invoic es and bank statements. She explained that she did not submit her resignation as direc tor of the India Company bec ause as alternate direc tor she would automatic ally c ease to be direc tor onc e the sec ond defendant resigned. 

84     Uma testified that she was the one who disc overed on a Registrar of Companies website that Yu had registered a c ompany in Bangalore, India on 30 August 2007. She did not dispute that she had produc ed no evidenc e that the plaintiff’s new c ompany was in direc t c ompetition with the India Company. She maintained that the plaintiff’s new c ompany bypassed the India Company to deal direc tly with the Indian telec ommunic ations operators. 

85     She c laimed that she was not aware that an order had been made for the produc tion of the hard disk of her laptop to the plaintiff’s expert in Singapore when the expert visited the India Company’s offic e on 2 Oc tober 2008. In a sudden twist, she revealed that she had been in Pondic herry with the laptop at the time. She had filed a polic e report stating that the laptop had been stolen from her c ar on 30 Oc tober 2008. She c laimed that she had left the laptop on the passenger seat and testified in c ross-examination that someone had broken the glass window of the c ar and stolen it (this detail was absent in the polic e report). 

**The parties’ submissions** 

86     In the c losing submissions for the plaintiff, its c ounsel essentially repeated the c ontentions in the pleadings and the positions taken by the plaintiff’s witnesses in their evidenc e. Henc e, I shall not repeat the points here. 

87     In the c losing submissions for the defendants, their c ounsel foc used on three main submissions. The first was that the Supply Agreement was valid only for one year, from 14 July 2004 to 13 July 

2005\. Thus, it was submitted that the defendants c ould only be liable as guarantors for supplies made during that period, and for that matter only up to a limit of $100,000 by virtue of artic le 12.2. Counsel for the defendants pointed out that the c ause of ac tion in the original statement of c laim filed on 7 September 2007 was based on the supplies made under the Supply Agreement. This was so even after the first amendment of the Statement of Claim on 5 February 2008. Furthermore, it was pointed out that artic le 5.4 of the Supply Agreement provided that: “At all times the terms of this agreement shall prevail over the terms of any purc hase order to be issued.” 

88     The sec ond submission was that an inferenc e that the Singapore Company was ac ting as agents for the India Company in c ontrac ting with the plaintiff c ould be made on the basis of three doc uments. The first doc ument was the 15 February 2007 MOU, under whic h the plaintiff had ac c epted the India Company as the debtor for US$1.8m (by virtue of paras 2, 3 and 15 of the 15 February 2007 MOU). The sec ond doc ument was the Cooperation Agreement, whic h was entered into between the plaintiff and the India Company and referred to the debt “owed by Sharon Global Solutions Pte Ltd (SGS) _and_ Sharon Solutions (India) Private Limited [emphasis added]”. Clause 1 of the Cooperation Agreement also provided that the plaintiff would not c ommenc e any legal ac tion against the India Company “in respec t of the debt”. Finally, there was a non-disc losure agreement entered into between the plaintiff and the India Company exhibited in Uma’s affidavit. 


89     The third submission was that the defendants had been disc harged from their liability under the Personal Guarantee by virtue of the plaintiff’s ac c eptanc e of the India Company as the debtor under the 15 Feb 2007 MOU, Cooperation Agreement and non-disc losure agreement. The Privy Counc il dec ision of _Commercial Bank of Tasmania v Jones_ [1893] AC 313 was c ited as authority for the proposition that the ac c eptanc e of another person as full debtor, c onstituting novation of the princ ipal debt, operates as an absolute release of the guarantor of the princ ipal debt. 

**The decision** 

90     I ac c epted the plaintiff’s c ontention that the Singapore Company and the plaintiff had a c ontrac tual relationship based on the terms of supply as set out in the SGS Purc hase Orders even before the Supply Agreement c ame into being. The proc edure stipulated for the supply of SIM c ards under artic les 5.2 and 5.3 of the Supply Agreement was the same as that whic h was used prior to the Supply Agreement and indeed even after its expiry. It was not disputed that even during the period of the Supply Agreement, individual c ontrac ts for the supply of SIM c ards were only formed when the purc hase orders issued by the Singapore Company were ac c epted by the plaintiff. 

91     The alleged admission by Neo that the plaintiff’s supply of SIM c ards was under the terms of the Supply Agreement was made prior to the amendment of the Statement of Claim. The relevant statement of c laim by the time of the trial was the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2). 

92     The Singapore Company itself had inc luded amounts representing transac tions pursuant to purc hase orders issued prior to the Supply Agreement in the Singapore Company’s statement of ac c ounts. I did not believe the sec ond defendant’s evidenc e that this statement of ac c ounts was ac tually generated by the plaintiff. On balanc e, Neo had been a more c redible witness than the sec ond defendant (I will deal with other instanc es of the sec ond defendant’s lac k of c redibility below) and I ac c epted her version of the events that had taken plac e on 12 Oc tober 2006 (see [50] above). The Singapore Company’s own ac c eptanc e of the debts under the purc hase orders in its statement of ac c ounts further meant that the defendants’ arguments that the plaintiff should have proc eeded to arbitration first and that the c laim should be limited to US$100,000 c ould not stand. 

93     I noted that the defendants never disputed signing the Personal Guarantee whic h c learly stated that the amount of US$2,114,846.40 was owed by the Singapore Company and made them the guarantors of this debt. The story whic h emerged in the c ross-examination of the first defendant that it was later disc overed that the debt was ac tually owed not by the Singapore Company but by the India Company was c learly an afterthought. It was inherently inc redible that the defendants would have signed a guarantee for suc h a large sum without first double-c hec king the amount by referenc e to the Singapore Company’s ac c ounts. Although Wang’s evidenc e on whether the first defendant had asked to be disc harged from the Personal Guarantee on 16 Marc h 2007 prior to the signing of the Cooperation Agreement was c onfused, taking into ac c ount the testimony of Szeto and Yu, I found on a balanc e of probabilities that the defendants were aware that they were liable for the sum stated in the Personal Guarantee, as guarantors of the princ ipal debt owed by the Singapore Company. Consideration was unnec essary as the Personal Guarantee was by way of deed; in any event if it was, the c onsideration was c onstituted by the plaintiff’s granting time to the Singapore Company to pay the outstanding debt as stated in para 4 of the Personal Guarantee. The fac t that the Personal Guarantee did not make any referenc e to the Supply Agreement further reinforc ed my view that the basis of the plaintiff’s c laim against the defendants lay in the SGS Purc hase Orders and not the Supply Agreement. 

94     The defendants’ c ontentions were often c ontradic tory and sat ill together. They c ould not maintain on the one hand that the Singapore Company had signed the SGS Purc hase Orders and 


entered into the Supply Agreement as agent for the India Company and on the one hand, c ontend that they were only liable for the supply of SIM c ards to the Singapore Company during the period of the Supply Agreement or that the 15 February 2007 MOU had effec ted a transfer of the Singapore Company’s debt to the India Company. It was little wonder that the defendants themselves often c ould not maintain a c onsistent position. For example, the first defendant had maintained in his AEIC (at para 13) that the plaintiff at all material times knew and ac c epted that the Singapore Company entered into the Supply Agreement as agents for the India Company. He later c ontradic ted this position when he testified that he had never said that the plaintiff’s c ontrac tual relationship was with the India Company. Finally, upon being pressed, he reverted to his original position that when the Supply Agreement was signed, the plaintiff’s c ontrac t was with the India Company. Yet another example of his inc onsistenc y was the first defendant’s averment that the 15 February 2007 MOU transferred the debt to the India Company. Later, he c hanged his position on the stand stating that his position was that the debt was always payable only by the India Company. His wife on the other hand, maintained on the stand that the 15 February 2007 MOU had transferred the debt to the India Company. 

95     In my view, there was insuffic ient evidenc e to show that the Singapore Company had issued the SGS Purc hase Orders and entered into the Supply Agreement as agent for the India Company. The phrase “for our India operations” in the SGS Purc hase Orders in 2004 did not prec lude the Singapore Company purc hasing as princ ipal the SIM c ards to be shipped to India. There was nothing on the fac e of the Supply Agreement to indic ate that the Singapore Company was c ontrac ting on behalf of another party. I also ac c epted the plaintiff’s position that the 15 February 2007 MOU was merely intended to give another avenue for the repayment of the debt ac c umulated by the Singapore Company and Yu’s evidenc e that he had failed to notic e that the debt was stated as owing from the India Company, bec ause the 15 February 2007 MOU was not vetted by his solic itor. Thus, the 15 February 2007 MOU c ould not c onstitute evidenc e of an agenc y relationship between the Singapore Company and the India Company. I also ac c epted the plaintiff’s position that the Cooperation Agreement was signed for the plaintiff to c arry out due diligenc e on the India Company in order to dec ide whether or not to ac c ept its shares as c ollateral (whic h position the sec ond defendant did not dispute). Thus, the Cooperation Agreement followed on from the 15 February 2007 MOU and was part of the plaintiff’s effort to find additional avenues for the repayment of the debt due from the Singapore Company. It did not c onstitute evidenc e of an agenc y relationship between the Singapore Company and the India Company. 

96     At this point it is apposite to deal with the 2004 MOU as the defendants had averred in their joint affidavit dated 13 Dec ember 2007 that the plaintiff would not have signed the 2004 MOU with the India Company if it had not known that the India Company was the princ ipal in the c ontrac ts for the supply of SIM c ards. The testimony of Teh and Westwood c learly showed that the 2004 MOU was a fabric ated doc ument. The defendants’ own c onstant c hange in position on when the 2004 MOU was signed was also damning. Furthermore, Neo’s evidenc e on the plaintiff’s rubber stamps and Tian’s testimony on the signing of the Al Hatim MOU undermined the defendants’ c laim that Teh had signed both the 2004 MOU and the Al Hatim MOU on 20 Dec ember 2005 using different stamps. The defendants’ rather desperate attempt to rely on a fabric ated doc ument and the falsehoods they had to tell to establish its genuineness c ast serious doubts on their general c redibility. 

97     I ac c epted Tian’s evidenc e on the reason for the India Company’s name and address being on the 2004 India invoic es. The Supply Agreement itself envisaged that the India Company’s address would generally be the billing address (see artic le 3 of the Supply Agreement set out in [7] above). It was partic ularly signific ant that the Singapore Company had itself inc luded the 2004 India invoic es in its statement of ac c ounts (and as mentioned in [92] above, I did not believe that the Singapore Company’s statement of ac c ounts was generated by the plaintiff ). I c onc luded that the Singapore 


Company was liable to pay the plaintiff in respec t of the 2004 India invoic es. I also found that the plaintiff’s explanation (as given by Yu and Neo) of why the statements of ac c ounts were different in eac h version of the Statement of Claim was sound. Thus, the defendants’ relianc e on the disc repanc ies in the various statements to c ast doubt on the genuineness of the plaintiff’s c laim was unsustainable. It was also noteworthy that the defendants had ac c epted that they owed the sums stated in the audit c onfirmations (whic h c orresponded with Sc hedule 2 of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2)). It was utterly inc redible that the sec ond defendant did not verify the sums by c hec king the Singapore Company’s ac c ounts before signing the audit c onfirmations. In any c ase, if she c hose not to do so, she c ould not now disavow her signature on the audit c onfirmations. The sec ond defendant’s unc orroborated testimony, that she only signed the audit c onfirmations under pressure, was not mentioned in either her or her husband’s affidavits and was c learly a weak attempt at trying to c ast doubt on the binding effec t of her signatures on the audit c onfirmations. 

98     Having rejec ted the defendants’ c ontention that the Singapore Company was ac ting as agent for the India Company, I then c onsidered whether there was a transfer of the princ ipal debt from the Singapore Company to the India Company under the 15 February 2007 MOU. It was eminently c lear from para 1 of the 15 February 2007 MOU that it was not a legally enforc eable agreement. The Cooperation Agreement ought to have formalised the arrangements envisaged by the 15 February 2007 MOU and thereby brought it into forc e, but the Cooperation Agreement was never in fac t implemented. The defendants’ own evidenc e showed that while the proc esses had c ommenc ed for the resignation of the sec ond defendant and Uma as direc tors of the India Company and for Yu to be appointed direc tor (in c omplianc e with c l 1(1)(a) and (b) of the Cooperation Agreement), they were never c ompleted. On Uma’s own evidenc e, it appeared that only the purc hase orders, c ustomer invoic es and bank statements for 2007 were given to Szeto and thus c l 2 of the Cooperation Agreement was also never effec ted. Apart from the few doc uments exhibited by Szeto, no other doc uments belonging to the India Company were produc ed as having been furnished to Szeto. On the sec ond defendant’s own evidenc e, the joint ac c ount envisaged in para 8 of the 15 February 2007 MOU was never formally opened. Nor was the transfer of shares from the India Company c arried out as evinc ed by c l 1(3) of the Cooperation Agreement. 

99     Sinc e the 15 February 2007 MOU was not legally binding and it was not brought into effec t by the Cooperation Agreement, the defendants’ submission that they had been disc harged from their obligations under the Personal Guarantee by virtue of the extension of time to pay the debt and/or a novation of the princ ipal debt under these agreements c ould not stand. 

100    The defendants’ c laims that the debt owed by the Singapore Company had been settled in full was c ompletely unsubstantiated by any doc umentary evidenc e and was also unsustainable in the fac e of the plaintiff’s c lear statements of ac c ounts. As for the c ontention that the server payments should be set off against the sum c laimed, I found, on c onsidering the evidenc e of Yu, Pessy, Neo, the first defendant and Uma that the 15 February 2007 e-mail was undoubtedly a fabric ation and was never in fac t sent by Uma to Pessy. The first defendant’s c laim that he was c opied the e-mail was extremely dubious given the lateness of the revelation that his laptop was damaged (not to mention his unc onvinc ing ac c ount of how it was damaged) and reflec ted poorly on his c redibility. Uma’s own story about how her laptop was stolen was even more inc redible and mind-boggling. She c ould not satisfac torily explain (see N/E 469) why she c hose to leave the laptop in plain view on the passenger seat next to the driver’s c ar. Her flimsy explanation that she had to leave it on the seat next to her when driving had nothing to do with storing it away in the boot as any sensible person would have done, if a laptop was to be left in an unattended c ar or overnight. In any c ase, it was c lear from the plaintiff’s statement of ac c ounts that the payments designated as server payments by the India Company had already been taken into c onsideration in c alc ulating the amount c laimed in this ac tion. 


101    Although it is true that the plaintiff had set up a new c ompany in India, there was no evidenc e to prove that this new c ompany was in fac t in c ompetition with the India Company. In any c ase, the plaintiff had established its c laim based on hard fac ts and doc umentary evidenc e and there was no reason to dismiss the c laim even if it had the effec t of driving a c ompetitor under. 

**Conclusion** 

102    Throughout the proc eedings, the defendants gave inc onsistent and sometimes inherently inc redible evidenc e. Their evidenc e often underwent surprising evolutions as reflec ted in their witnesses’ evidenc e on the 2004 MOU and the 15 February 2007 e-mail. I entertained serious doubts on their c redibility as well as that of their witness Uma. In c ontrast, the plaintiff presented a straightforward and c oherent c ase with ample doc umentary evidenc e. 

103    Consequently, I awarded judgment to the plaintiff on its c laim in the sum of US$1,623,346.60 with interest from the date of the writ (7 September 2007) with c osts on a standard basis to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.
