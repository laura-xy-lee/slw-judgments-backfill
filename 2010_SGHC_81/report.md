1       The ac c used was 39 years old. He owned a c ompany c alled “JMS Call Centre Pte Ltd” whic h c arried on the business of telemarketing from its offic e at Jalan Besar. He c laimed trial to five c harges of drug traffic king. The c harges c onc erned offenc es oc c urring on two days, namely, 27 Dec ember 2007 and 31 Dec ember 2007. The first c harge (C1) was in respec t of 14.99g of diamorphine; the sec ond (C2), 0.42g of methamphetamine; the third (C3), 8.76g of methamphetamine; the fourth (C4), 6.43g of diamorphine; and the fifth (C5), 0.01g of morphine. The c luster of c harges c onc erning the offenc es alleged to have been c ommitted on 31 Dec ember 2007 (“first c luster”) were the main ones although the other c luster of three c harges were in respec t of offenc es alleged to have been c ommitted four days previously (“sec ond c luster”). Both c lusters c onc erned the ac c used in c onspirac y with others. In the c ase of the first c luster, with Maryati Binte Sipon (“Maryati”) Khairul Anwar Bin Zaini (“Khairul”), Jamaliah binti Yac ab (“Jamaliah”), and a male person known only as “Boy Cino”; and in the c ase of the sec ond c luster, with Khairul, Jamaliah and Boy Cino only. Maryati, Khairul, and Jamaliah had pleaded guilty for their roles in the transac tions in question and are serving varying sentenc es of imprisonment eac h. I begin with the first c luster. 

2       Maryati testified for the prosec ution. She said that on the morning of 31 Dec ember 2007 she brought along her sevenyear old daughter Nur Fitri along to meet the ac c used. She was given S$30,500 by the ac c used and she went to Johor Bahru, Malaysia where she c hanged the money into M$69,692.50. She then handed that money over to Boy Cino. Jamaliah also testified on behalf of the prosec ution and she said that about 1pm or 2pm Boy Cino c alled her and arranged for her to c ollec t a plastic bag in whic h was a detergent box where the drugs in question were c onc ealed. She was instruc ted to bring the drugs ac ross to Singapore and hand them to Khairul. At 5.25pm she c rossed over to Singapore and headed to Khairul’s flat at Bloc k 19, Telok Blangah Cresc ent. She met Khairul at the 10th floor lift landing and handed the plastic bag with the drugs to him. He gave her $50 as transport money bac k to Malaysia. Both of them were arrested moments after they had c ompleted the transac tion. There was no dispute that the drugs seized from Khairul here were the drugs in respec t of the first c luster of c harges. Khairul’s flat was searc hed and more drugs were seized. These were the remnants of the drugs delivered to him by Jamaliah in c onspirac y with the ac c used in respec t of the sec ond c luster of c harges. 

3       Maryati maintained her evidenc e that she was given the money by the ac c used to hand to Boy 


Cino. She also maintained that Boy Cino telephoned the ac c used to c onfirm that he had rec eived the money. Shortly after that the ac c used telephoned Maryati to say she c ould leave. The evidenc e from the prosec ution’s narrative showed that after Maryati left, Boy Cino c ontac ted Jamaliah to deliver the drugs to Khairul. Maryati and Jamaliah maintained their evidenc e even under c rossexamination. Khairaul, on the other hand, retrac ted his earlier statement rec orded on 26 August 2008 (P142) stating that the ac c used was the one who instruc ted him in the delivery of the drugs c onc erned in the five c harges against the ac c used. In c ourt, he testified under c rossexamination that he gave the statement eight months after his arrest bec ause he was c oerc ed into doing it. He gave no c onvinc ing details as to how he was c oerc ed apart from the fac t that he was fac ing the death sentenc e. I was not persuaded by his testimony under c rossexamination. I ac c ept his statement of 26 August (P142) as c orroborative of the overall evidenc e against the ac c used. The main evidenc e against the ac c used was the testimony of Maryati whic h I found to be reliable. If Maryati was telling the truth, the ac c used must be lying. Henc e, Mr Dhillon, c ounsel for the ac c used, subjec ted her to a strenuous c rossexamination, but I do not think that either her c redibility or her story was disc redited. I was satisfied that Maryati’s evidenc e was reliable. 

4       The ac c used was arrested in his offic e at Jalan Besar at 6.30pm on 31 Dec ember 2007. Nothing inc riminating was found on him or in his offic e. The evidenc e against him c ame mainly from the testimonies of Maryati and Khairul, and, indirec tly, Jamaliah, whose evidenc e c ompleted the prosec ution’s narrative. The ac c used elec ted to testify in his defenc e when his defenc e was c alled. He had no witness other than himself. Mr Dhillon submitted that the telephone c all made from telephone number 962XXXXX (from a phone registered in the name of the ac c used) to Maryati on 30 Dec ember at 11.44pm did not belong to the ac c used. First, he submitted that Khairul agreed that the ac c used had only one c ellphone and that was 919XXXXX. Sec ondly, there were c alls made from 962XXXXX from Malaysia between 20 and 25 Dec ember 2007, and that proved that they were not by the ac c used bec ause he did not have a passport and did not travel to Malaysia. That may remain a mystery but it would not absolve the ac c used and neither is it suffic ient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether Maryati’s evidenc e was unreliable. I am of the opinion that the evidenc e that the ac c used used only 919XXXXX was unreliable. On the other hand, even so far as telephone number 919XXXXX was c onc erned, on 26 Dec ember 2007, there were 35 c ommunic ations with the other ac c omplic es. The number, frequenc y and timing of the c ommunic ations indic ated that a c oordinated ac tivity was in progress, c ontrary to the evidenc e of the ac c used that he was only making small talk. I was unable to ac c ept the explanation that the ac c used had given his c ell phone 962XXXXX to a man known only as “Bob”. I also did not ac c ept the explanation as to why Bob c ould not be loc ated to testify on behalf of the ac c used. I also noted that the various c ell phones were, on the ac c used person’s own evidenc e, liberally borrowed by the persons in the ac c used’s c irc le of friends. 

5       There was another piec e of prosec ution evidenc e that the ac c used disputed. The prosec ution adduc ed a message from the short message system whic h the ac c used sent to Boy Cino. It stated in Malay, “Boy kuda dah jalan?” The interpreter’s evidenc e was that it meant “Boy has the horse moved?” Maryati and Khairul understood the message as a message addressed to Boy Cino, asking him (Boy Cino) whether the c ourier had moved (left or started off ). The ac c used insisted that the words “Boy kuda” was a nic kname for another friend c alled “Rashid”. The c irc umstanc es did not seem to justify this and no other evidenc e was led to persuade me that a Rashid who was also known as “Boy kuda" existed. I was not inc lined to ac c ept the ac c used person’s explanation. Defenc e c ounsel submitted that the c all rec ords should not be taken into ac c ount if other evidenc e c ontradic ts them. I was of the view that the c all rec ords are part of the evidenc e upon whic h I evaluate the verac ity of the witnesses. A witness is believed or disbelieved not only by what he says or how he says it, but also by how his story c ompares with other evidenc e. 

6       For the reasons above, I was of the view that the prosec ution had proved its c ase against the 


ac c used beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore found the ac c used guilty and c onvic ted him on all the five c harges. In mitigation, the ac c used said that he had no trouble with the law sinc e 2000 although his c onvic tions were rec orded only in 2004, for whic h he was sentenc ed to a total of 36 months’ imprisonment, in c onnec tion with the c onsumption of morphine and breac hes of supervision orders. He also stated that bec ause of his terminal illness, a long prison sentenc e will effec tively be a “death sentenc e” for him. He has a 17year old daughter and two sons aged 11 and 15 respec tively. 

7       The learned DPP, Mr Ng Cheng Thiam, drew my attention to the sentenc es meted out to the c oac c used persons. After taking into ac c ount the mitigation, I was of the view that in sentenc ing this ac c used the sentenc es of his c oac c used, who had all pleaded guilty, should be taken into ac c ount also. I, therefore, sentenc ed this ac c used to a total of 30 years imprisonment and 24 strokes of the c ane. The sentenc e of imprisonment was to take effec t from 2 January 2008.
