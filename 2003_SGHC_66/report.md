_Criminal Procedure and Sentencing_ – _Sentencing_ – _Principles_ – _Husband kicking wife upon discovering she was lying to him_ – _Whether motive for offence relevant for sentencing under s 304 (a) Penal Code, Cap 224._ 

1       The ac c used, aged 34, pleaded guilty to a c harge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code Ch 224 for c ausing the death of his wife Norafidah Binte Saparuan, also aged 34. The ac c used was unemployed. Norafidah’s marriage to the ac c used had been de-stabilised and the c ouple were in c onflic t in more ways than one. Norafidah was seeing another man (Sheik Abdullah) and wanted a divorc e. The ac c used wanted rec onc iliation. 

2       On 27 August 2002 Norafidah spent the night at Sheik Abdullah’s flat. They left the flat at 7am the following morning and walked to the bus-stop together. Sheik Abdullah’s bus arrived first and he left for work. The ac c used and another man c onfronted Norafidah at the bus-stop before her bus arrived. The ac c used asked her to take him to Sheik Abdullah’s flat and then told her to c all him (Sheik Abdullah) bac k to the flat. 

3       The party c onsisting of Norafidah, the ac c used and the other man reac hed the flat a while later. A woman named Sharrifah who lived there was still in bed, and so was her daughter Siti Shehah. It was not known what their relationship was with Sheik Abdullah. A c ommotion arose when the ac c used lost his temper after hearing Sharrifah refer to Norafidah as a "divorc ee". He punc hed Norafidah who fell but the ac c used’s friend helped her bac k on her feet. 

4       To avoid embarrassment and attention Siti Shehah asked everyone to go into the flat. By this time, the ac c used’s male friend had left but an unknown woman friend joined them. The ac c used and Sharrifah sat on the sofa and Norafidah and the unknown woman sat on the floor with their bac ks to the wall. 

5       The ac c used was still in a foul mood and it darkened further when he learnt that Norafidah had lied to him more than he had suspec ted. Questioning Sharrifah, he found out that Norafidah did not c ome to the flat to help Sharrifah bake c ookies as she had told him. Thereupon, he walked to Norafidah and told her to lower her hand from her mouth. He then kic ked her in the mouth. The forc e c aused her head to jerk bac kwards, hitting the wall. Resulting from the impac t with the wall Norafidah developed an instantaneous epileptic fit. There was no doubt that the kic k was an extremely violent one. It appears that the impac t had c aused a subarac hnoid haemorrhage in her skull. She died from her head injury. The ac c used initially tried to revive her but fled when he realised the seriousness of her injury. However, he instruc ted the unknown woman to c all for the ambulanc e before leaving the sc ene. 

6       The fac ts show that this c ase c ould have been brought as an offenc e under s 304(b) of the Penal Code instead of s 304 (a). Under s 304(b) the punishment is imprisonment of up to ten years or fine whereas the punishment for an offenc e under s 304(a) is imprisonment for life or ten years. A c ase may justifiably be brought under s 304(b) if death was c aused without the intention to c ause death 


or the intention to c ause suc h bodily injury as is likely to c ause death. Whether the injury in the present c ase falls within (a) or (b) of s 304 may depend on whether the injury was the kic k itself or the kic k and the resulting impac t against the wall. 

7       Whether the ac c used ought to be c harged under (a) or (b) is a matter at the prosec utor’s disc retion and must so be respec ted. In this c ase, the prosec ution c ase was presented by an experienc ed and learned prosec uting c ounsel, Mr Jaswant Singh, and, furthermore, the ac c used was represented by c ounsel of equal standing. In determining the appropriate sentenc e, the c ourt must find a range within the limits presc ribed under s 304(a) alone. That the fac ts might have justified the c harge being brought under s 304(b) would not be relevant. 

8       In this c ase, I took into ac c ount that the offenc e was c ommitted in the c ulmination of deep feelings none less than the passion of ‘love to hatred turned’. I think it a fair and reasonable inferenc e that the ac c used had not intended or apprec iated the impac t c aused by Norafidah’s head hitting the wall. In the c irc umstanc es, I am of the view that a sentenc e between 7 to 9 years imprisonment as suggested by the learned DPP is not appropriate in this c ase. That may be more appropriate in c ases where the offender has a deeper and more wilful motive, or c ases where the physic al assault is more heinous. I mention this without diminishing my view that the assault in the present c ase was a violent one. But given the c irc umstanc es of this c ase, I think that a sentenc e of 5 years imprisonment is suffic ient.
